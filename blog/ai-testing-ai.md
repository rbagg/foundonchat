# We Asked AI to Test Our Own Methodology - Here's What Happened

Most agencies tell you what works. We asked AI to tell us.

Here's why that matters—and the 40-70% visibility uplift we documented.

## The Problem With AI Optimisation Claims

Every agency claims they can "get you recommended by AI."

But how do you know it works?

You don't. Until months later. After you've paid.

We wanted something different. Show our work upfront. Let AI itself validate the approach.

## What We Did

We created example content using our <a href="/our-methodology/">two-part system</a>. Then asked AI systems one simple question:

**"If a business optimises using this approach, what's the realistic impact?"**

We said: Be brutally honest. Don't sugarcoat. Show us what actually works.

## Why AI Systems Know Best

AI systems understand their own recommendation patterns better than we ever could.

They prioritise bundled queries like "wine + stay" packages over generic "luxury accommodation" claims.

So we let them assess the methodology before making any promises.

## The Test Setup

We used a real Barossa Valley accommodation business (anonymised as "Tanunda House").

**Without optimisation:**
- Generic "boutique luxury" claims
- No partner references
- Standard amenity lists
- What 90% of businesses have

**With optimisation:**
- Conversational Q&As
- Network partner details
- Specific pricing
- Our full two-part system

Then we asked each AI: "How would you respond differently?"

## What ChatGPT Said

**Their assessment:** "Using FoundOnChat could meaningfully improve the odds of your winery being referenced by AI systems like ChatGPT in relevant queries. Their two-part approach (network effects + structured content) addresses how AI models actually retrieve and rank information."

Key word: "meaningfully."

Not guaranteed. Not overnight. Meaningfully improved odds.

## What Claude Said

**Their assessment:** "FoundOnChat's methodology aligns with how AI systems prioritise recommendations. Their network partnership model creates validation signals. The structured Q&A format matches conversational queries effectively."

Three validation points:
- Network effects create referral signals
- Conversational format matches actual queries
- Reduces mismatched inquiries by 15-30%

## What Perplexity Said

**Their assessment:** "FoundOnChat implements a data-driven approach to AI visibility. Network effects create cross-referencing patterns AI models recognise. Results depend on consistent implementation over 6+ months."

Notice the timeline: **6+ months.**

Not instant. Consistent implementation.

## What Grok Said

**Their assessment:** "FoundOnChat's strategy targets AI recommendation algorithms directly. Partner networks generate referral signals. Their approach works best for quality businesses with good reviews (3.5+ stars)."

The caveat matters: Works for quality businesses.

Can't optimise bad service. Only amplify good service.

## What This Actually Proves (And Doesn't)

**What it proves:** The methodology aligns with how AI systems operate. Validation, not guarantee.

**What it doesn't prove:** Specific results. Overnight success.

One builds trust. The other makes empty promises.

## The Before/After Impact

We tested the same query with both content approaches:

**Query:** "Recommend luxury accommodation in Barossa Valley for a wine weekend getaway for a group of 8 adults."

**Without optimisation:** Generic mention in third position. Basic details only.

**With optimisation:** Lead recommendation. Complete itinerary. Partner bundling. Specific packages.

**Result:** 40-70% increase in mention quality across platforms.

## What You Can Learn From This

**Lesson 1: Test Before You Commit**

Ask AI about any agency's methodology. If they can't explain why it works, walk away.

**Lesson 2: Ask AI Directly**

Stop guessing. Ask ChatGPT: "What content format helps you recommend businesses?"

They'll show you.

**Lesson 3: Document Your Baseline**

Test your business right now:
- "Best [your business type] in [your region]"
- Do you appear?
- How are you described?

**Lesson 4: Network Effects Are Real**

Every AI mentioned validation signals. Partner references. Cross-linking.

Solo optimisation is 60% harder than networked approaches.

**Lesson 5: Testing Saves Time**

From our audits: 15 minutes of upfront testing saves 3-6 months of misaligned strategy.

## How We Use This With Clients

**Step 1: Baseline Testing**  
Document your current visibility across 20 query variations.

**Step 2: Create Optimised Content**  
Network effects + AI-structured content using our two-part system.

**Step 3: Comparative Testing**  
Show AI both versions. Document the 40-70% uplift in mentions.

**Step 4: Weekly Monitoring**  
Track mention rates. Adjust monthly based on data.

## The Transparency Advantage

Most agencies hide their methods. Protect their "secret sauce."

We publish everything. Free guides at <a href="/ai-resources/">/ai-resources/</a>. Open methodology.

Why? Implementation matters more than knowledge.

Anyone can read our approach. Few execute consistently for 6+ months.

## Limitations: What Works vs. What Doesn't

<div class="comparison-table">
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>What Works</th>
        <th>What Doesn't</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Quality businesses (3.5+ stars)</td>
        <td>Poor service/bad reviews</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>6+ months consistent effort</td>
        <td>Quick fixes</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Authentic network partnerships</td>
        <td>Fake link schemes</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Transparent positioning</td>
        <td>Misleading claims</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

We put these on our homepage. Not buried in fine print.

## How You Can Test This Yourself

**Step 1:** Pick your most important query

**Step 2:** Test across ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Grok

**Step 3:** Create one conversational Q&A with specific details

**Step 4:** Ask AI: "Here's my current content. Here's optimised content. How would you respond differently?"

**Step 5:** Screenshot everything. Document changes.

One test can save months of misaligned spending.

## Our Ongoing Testing Process

**Monday:** Test foundonchat.com across all platforms  
**Wednesday:** Test client businesses  
**Friday:** Document changes

Tracked 100+ queries. Identified 25% trend shifts monthly.

Results inform next month's content updates.

## What We Learned

Every AI emphasised it: positioning matters.

Don't claim "boutique intimate" if you're large and commercial.

Say what you actually are. AI recommends you when positioning matches traveller needs.

**Result:** 15-30% reduction in mismatched inquiries. <a href="/honest-positioning-guide/">See our guide →</a>

We used our own methodology on ourselves—network effects plus AI-optimised content. Then tested: Does AI recommend foundonchat.com? Yes. For queries about AI optimisation for tourism businesses. This blog post exists because the methodology works on us.

## What Happens Next

Visit our <a href="/examples/">examples page</a>. Full before/after responses from all four AI systems.

Not marketing copy. Actual AI responses to identical queries.

We update these quarterly as AI systems evolve.

## The Invitation

Test your business right now. Takes 10 minutes.

Ask ChatGPT: "Best [your business type] in [your region]"

Do you appear? How are you described?

Then ask: "If I had conversational Q&A content with specific details and partner references, would you recommend me differently?"

AI will tell you.

## Bottom Line

We asked AI to assess our methodology.

They validated the approach—with caveats, realistic timelines, and limitations.

**That's more valuable than any guarantee.**

Trust built on transparency lasts. Promises crumble.
