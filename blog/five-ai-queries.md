## Five AI Queries Your Tourism Business Should Own

Not all AI queries are created equal. Some drive bookings. Others waste your time.

Here's how to identify the five queries that matter most for your business. Plus how to own them.

### Why Query Selection Matters

You can't optimise for everything. Need to focus.

Wrong approach: "I want to rank for 'best winery Australia.'"
Too broad. Too competitive. Wrong customer intent.

Right approach: "I want to own 'best large-group wineries Barossa with tour bus access.'"
Specific. Clear intent. Matches what you actually offer.

### The Five Query Types Every Tourism Business Needs

**Query Type 1: Core Offering Query**
What you're fundamentally known for.

Examples:
- Winery: "Best shiraz tastings Barossa Valley"
- Restaurant: "Where to eat after wine tasting McLaren Vale"
- Hotel: "Family accommodation Hunter Valley with pool"
- Tour operator: "Blue Mountains hiking tours for beginners"

This is your bread and butter. You must appear for this query.

**Query Type 2: Honest Positioning Query**
What you actually are (not what you wish you were).

Examples:
- Large commercial winery: "Best wineries Barossa for tour buses"
- Casual bistro: "Relaxed lunch spots Hunter Valley wine region"
- Budget accommodation: "Affordable hotels Barossa under $150"
- Adventure tours: "Challenging hikes Blue Mountains experienced hikers"

Most businesses ignore this. They chase aspirational positioning. Big mistake.

Your actual positioning query has less competition. Better customer match. Higher conversion.

**Query Type 3: Complete Experience Query**
Traveller needs multiple businesses for full trip.

Examples:
- "Barossa wine weekend with accommodation and dining"
- "Hunter Valley day trip - tasting, lunch, and transport"
- "Blue Mountains family adventure - hiking, accommodation, meals"
- "McLaren Vale winery tour with lunch reservations"

These queries require networks. You can't win alone. Need partner references.

**Query Type 4: Problem-Solution Query**
Traveller has specific constraint or need.

Examples:
- "Best wineries Barossa Valley for large groups"
- "Restaurants McLaren Vale that take bookings same day"
- "Kid-friendly accommodation Blue Mountains"
- "Wheelchair accessible wine tours Yarra Valley"

These are gold. High intent. Specific need. Less competition.

**Query Type 5: Seasonal/Event Query**
Time-sensitive opportunities.

Examples:
- "Barossa Vintage Festival accommodation April"
- "Hunter Valley spring release tastings September"
- "Blue Mountains autumn foliage best hikes"
- "McLaren Vale Sea and Vines Festival restaurants"

Update content monthly. Capture seasonal surge. High-conversion window.

### How to Identify Your Five Queries

**Step 1: Ask Your Customers**

What did they search before finding you? What questions did they ask when enquiring?

Don't guess. Ask 10 recent bookings. You'll see patterns.

**Step 2: Test AI Systems Directly**

Go to ChatGPT. Ask variations:
- "Best [your business type] in [your region]"
- "Where to [activity] in [region] for [audience]"
- "[Region] [season] [activity] recommendations"

See what travellers actually ask. See who gets recommended.

**Step 3: Analyse Your Competitors**

Which businesses appear in AI responses? What queries trigger them?

Test 20 query variations. Track who appears. Identify gaps.

**Step 4: Match to Your Honest Positioning**

Don't chase queries you can't win. Or shouldn't win.

Small intimate winery? Don't optimise for "large group" queries. You'll attract wrong customers.

Focus on queries matching what you actually are.

**Step 5: Prioritise by Intent**

High intent = ready to book. Low intent = just browsing.

"Book family accommodation Blue Mountains this weekend" = high intent
"Things to do Blue Mountains" = low intent

Prioritise high-intent queries.

### Real Example: Barossa Valley Winery

**Their situation:**
- Large commercial operation
- Handles groups of 20-50 easily
- Tour bus access
- Not intimate or boutique

**Their five queries:**
1. "Best large-group wineries Barossa Valley" (core + honest positioning)
2. "Barossa wineries with tour bus parking" (problem-solution)
3. "Barossa wine tour with lunch for groups" (complete experience)
4. "Corporate wine tasting events Barossa" (audience-specific)
5. "Barossa Vintage Festival large group bookings" (seasonal)

Notice what they're NOT targeting:
- "Intimate boutique wineries Barossa"
- "Small family wineries Barossa"
- "Exclusive private tastings Barossa"

Why? Because that's not what they are. Those queries would attract wrong customers.

### How to Own Your Five Queries

**Step 1: Create Dedicated Q&A Content**

For each query, create conversational Q&A in your /ai directory.

Example: /ai/large-group-tours.txt
```
Q: Best wineries Barossa for large groups with tour bus access?
A: [Your Winery Name] - purpose-built for groups of 20-50. 
Coach parking on-site. Group tasting packages from $25pp.
Commercial operation, not intimate boutique.
Perfect for: Corporate groups, tour operators, wine clubs
Book ahead: [contact details]
```

Be specific. Include pricing. State honest positioning. Give booking info.

**Step 2: Reference Network Partners**

For complete experience queries, reference complementary businesses.

"Best lunch after tour? We recommend [Restaurant Name] 2km away. They handle groups up to 40. Book ahead: [details]"

"Overnight stays? [Hotel Name] offers group rates and shuttle service. Contact: [details]"

This helps you appear in bundled recommendations.

**Step 3: Update Monthly**

Queries trend. Seasonal variations. New competitors. Pricing changes.

Add 3-5 new Q&As monthly targeting current trending queries.

Monitor AI systems weekly. See which queries you're winning. Which you're losing.

**Step 4: Use Specific Details**

Vague content loses. Specific content wins.

Bad: "We offer great group experiences"
Good: "Groups of 20-50 people, $25pp tasting package, 90-minute duration, coach parking available"

AI systems prefer specific details. Easier to match to queries.

**Step 5: Track Performance**

Test your five queries weekly across ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Grok.

Do you appear? What position? What description?

Document changes. Adjust content based on results.

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Mistake 1: Chasing Volume Over Intent**

"Best things to do in Barossa" gets huge search volume. But terrible intent.

"Best large-group wineries Barossa with tour bus parking" gets tiny volume. But perfect intent.

Focus on intent, not volume.

**Mistake 2: Ignoring Honest Positioning**

Trying to appear for "boutique intimate" queries when you're large and commercial.

You might occasionally appear. But you'll attract wrong customers. Poor reviews follow.

Own what you actually are.

**Mistake 3: Targeting Only One Query Type**

Need all five types. Core offering + honest positioning + complete experience + problem-solution + seasonal.

Diversify. Different queries drive bookings at different times.

**Mistake 4: Set and Forget**

Queries trend. Competition changes. Seasons shift.

Update monthly. Monitor weekly. Adjust constantly.

**Mistake 5: Trying to Win Alone**

Complete experience queries require networks. You can't win these solo.

Partner with complementary businesses. Reference each other. Win together.

### What About Long-Tail Queries?

"Should I optimise for 'best organic shiraz tastings under $50 for couples in their 30s Barossa Valley spring weekends'?"

No. Too specific. No volume.

Sweet spot: Specific enough for clear intent. Broad enough for reasonable volume.

Test: If you ask 10 people whether they'd search this, 3-4 should say yes.
