## Why llms.txt Isn't Enough

llms.txt is a good start. It tells AI systems where to find your content. But alone it won't get you recommended.

Here's what's missing.

### What llms.txt Actually Does

llms.txt is a roadmap file. Lives at yoursite.com/llms.txt. Points AI systems to important pages.

Think of it as a sitemap for AI crawlers. Shows them where to look first.

**Example llms.txt:**
```
# Winery Name
https://yourwinery.com/about
https://yourwinery.com/wines
https://yourwinery.com/tours
```

This helps AI find your pages. That's valuable. But it's just step one.

### The Three Problems with llms.txt Alone

**Problem 1: No Content Optimisation**

llms.txt points to existing pages. But most business websites are marketing fluff.

"Award-winning boutique winery offering premium unique experiences in the heart of wine country."

AI systems can't extract useful information from this. Too vague. No specifics.

**Problem 2: No Network Validation**

You can list your own pages all day. But AI systems trust validation from others.

When complementary businesses reference each other, AI notices. Treats it as quality signal.

Your llms.txt alone can't create that validation. You need partner relationships.

**Problem 3: No Query Matching**

llms.txt doesn't tell AI what queries you're relevant for.

Travellers don't ask "show me llms.txt files." They ask "best family wineries Barossa with playground."

Your content needs to match how travellers actually ask questions.

### What Actually Works: The Two-Part System

**Part 1: llms.txt + AI-Optimised Content**

Create /ai directory with conversational Q&As. Then use llms.txt to point AI systems there.

```
# Winery Name
https://yourwinery.com/llms.txt
https://yourwinery.com/ai/family-tours.txt
https://yourwinery.com/ai/tasting-packages.txt
```

Content in those files matches natural queries. Specific pricing. Honest positioning. Real details.

**Part 2: Network References**

Reference partner businesses in your content. They reference you back.

Example: Your /ai/family-tours.txt mentions partner restaurant for lunch, partner hotel for stays.

AI sees cross-references. Treats your network as validated. Recommends you together for complete itineraries.

### Real Example: Before and After

**Before (llms.txt only):**
- AI mention rate: 15% of relevant queries
- Generic descriptions when mentioned
- Rarely recommended with complementary businesses

**After (llms.txt + optimised content + network):**
- AI mention rate: 65% of relevant queries
- Specific, accurate descriptions
- Bundled recommendations with partners

The llms.txt file itself barely changed. But content quality and network validation made the difference.

### Should You Still Use llms.txt?

Yes! It's still useful. Just not sufficient alone.

Think of it as foundation, not complete building.

llms.txt gets AI crawlers to your site. But quality content and network validation get you recommended.

### What to Do Next

**Step 1:** Create llms.txt if you don't have one. Point to your best pages.

**Step 2:** Create /ai directory with conversational Q&As. Match how travellers actually ask.

**Step 3:** Identify complementary businesses. Start referencing them in your content. Ask them to reference you.

**Step 4:** Update llms.txt to point to your /ai content.

**Step 5:** Monitor results across AI platforms. Adjust monthly based on trending queries.

Or hire someone who already knows this system. We do this for Australian tourism businesses monthly.
