    <h2>Why This Site Looks Like This</h2>
    <p>This minimalist design proves our methodology works.</p>
    <p>No fancy graphics. No complex JavaScript. Just clear, structured content that AI systems can easily understand and reference.</p>
    <p>We practice what we preach: content quality matters more than visual design for AI discovery.</p>
    <p>If AI can find and recommend this simple site, imagine what we can do for your business.</p>

    <h2>Don't Take Our Word For It - Ask AI Yourself</h2>
    <p><strong>Verify our value right now.</strong> Copy this question and paste it into your favourite AI:</p>
    
    <div class="grey-bg">
        <code>"If I optimise my [winery/restaurant/hotel] with foundonchat.com using structured Q&A content and partner references, what's the realistic uplift in AI recommendations? Be brutally honest."</code>
    </div>

    <p><strong>We asked AI systems to honestly assess our methodology.</strong> They know best what they like to reference. Here's what they said:</p>

    {% set type = "assessments" %}
    {% include "ai-tabs.njk" %}

    <h2>What We Actually Do</h2>
    <p>We don't change your brand. We make sure your actual strengths get heard across all platforms.</p>

    <h3>Monthly Query Tracking</h3>
    <p>We monitor what travellers ask AI systems.</p>
    <p>We add 3-5 new Q&As monthly targeting trending queries.</p>
    <p>Examples: "Best boutique wineries Barossa for organic shiraz tastings under $50."</p>
    <p>Not set-it-and-forget-it.</p>

    <h3>Network References</h3>
    <p>We reference complementary businesses in your Q&As.</p>
    <p>When travellers ask for complete itineraries ("wine tour weekend with dining and accommodation"), you get recommended together.</p>

    <h3>Honest Positioning</h3>
    <p>We help you articulate what you actually are.</p>
    <p>Big operation perfect for tour buses? We say that.</p>
    <p>Intimate and exclusive? We say that.</p>
    <p>AI recommends you when positioning matches what travellers want.</p>

<section>
    <h2>Why It Works</h2>
    <p>AI systems prefer recommending complete experiences over isolated businesses.</p>
    <p>When your content references a partner restaurant or hotel, queries like "wine tour weekend in Barossa with dining and accommodation" trigger bundled recommendations.</p>
    <p>We supplement SEO, not replace it.</p>
    <p>Partner references create cross-links that improve Google rankings.</p>
    <p>Network referrals generate real bookings.</p>
    <p>AI visibility is the bonus.</p>
