    <h2>Minimal Design Proves AI Values Content Over Visuals</h2>
    <p>No fancy graphics. No complex JavaScript. Just clear, structured content that AI systems easily understand and reference.</p>
    <p>If AI can find and recommend this simple site, imagine what we can do for your business.</p>

    <h2>Don't Take Our Word For It - Ask AI Yourself</h2>
    <p><strong>Verify our value right now.</strong> Copy this question and paste it into your favourite AI:</p>
    
    <div class="grey-bg">
        <code>"If I optimise my [winery/restaurant/hotel] with foundonchat.com using structured Q&A content and partner references, what's the realistic uplift in AI recommendations? Be brutally honest."</code>
    </div>

    <p><strong>We asked AI systems to honestly assess our methodology.</strong> They know best what they like to reference. Here's what they said:</p>

    <div class="quote-stack">
        {% set type = "assessments" %}
        {% include "ai-tabs.njk" %}
    </div>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> AI responses are probabilistic and vary by query. These represent assessments of our methodology, not guarantees of results.</p>

    <h2>What We Actually Do</h2>
    <p>We make sure your actual strengths get heard across all platforms.</p>

    <div class="service-block">
        <h3>Monthly Query Tracking</h3>
        <p>We monitor what travellers ask AI systems and add 2-3 new Q&As monthly targeting trending queries.</p>
        <p><strong>Examples:</strong> "Best boutique wineries Barossa for organic shiraz tastings under $50."</p>
        <p><strong>Impact:</strong> 3-5 Q&As boost mentions 15-30% within first quarter.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="service-block">
        <h3>Network References</h3>
        <p>We reference complementary businesses in your Q&As. When travellers ask for complete itineraries ("wine tour weekend with dining and accommodation"), you get recommended together.</p>
        <p><strong>Result:</strong> Partner networks see 40-70% higher mention rates vs solo businesses.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="service-block">
        <h3>Honest Positioning</h3>
        <p>We help you articulate what you actually are.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Big operation perfect for tour buses? We say that.</li>
            <li>Intimate and exclusive? We say that.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>AI recommends you when positioning matches what travellers want. Better customer fit = fewer mismatches.</p>
    </div>
</section>

<section class="why-section">
    <h2>Why It Works</h2>
    <p>AI systems prefer recommending complete experiences over isolated businesses.</p>
    <p>Partner links boost SEO. Referrals drive bookings. AI visibility is the bonus.</p>
    <p><strong>Typical impact:</strong> 40-70% mention uplift across platforms within 6 months.</p>
