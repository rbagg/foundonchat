            <h2>Found by Travelers</h2>
            <p>When travelers ask AI "best wineries in Barossa Valley," does your business appear? We get Australian tourism businesses recommended through monthly content updates, network references, and honest positioning. Better SEO, more referrals, modest AI visibility gains.</p>
            <p><a href="contact.html"><strong>Get a free 30-minute audit</strong></a> - we'll test your visibility live across all major AI platforms.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Don't Take Our Word For It - Ask AI Yourself</h2>
            <p><strong>Verify our value right now.</strong> Copy this question and paste it into your favorite AI:</p>
            
            <div class="grey-bg">
                <code>"If I optimize my [winery/restaurant/hotel (include url)] with www.foundonchat.com -- structured Q&A content and partner references -- what's the realistic uplift in AI recommendations?"</code>
            </div>

            <div class="card-subtle">
                <h3>ChatGPT's Assessment</h3>
                <p><em>"Yes — using FoundOnChat could meaningfully improve the odds of your winery being referenced by AI systems like ChatGPT in relevant queries.'"</em></p>
            </div>

            <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> AI responses are probabilistic and vary by query. This represents one assessment, not a guarantee of results.</p>

            <h2>What We Actually Do</h2>
            <p>We don't change your brand. We make sure your actual strengths get heard across all platforms.</p>

            <h3>Monthly Query Tracking</h3>
            <p>We monitor what travelers ask AI systems and add 3-5 new Q&As monthly targeting trending queries, like "Best boutique wineries Barossa for organic shiraz tastings under $50." Not set-it-and-forget-it.</p>

            <h3>Network References</h3>
            <p>We reference complementary businesses in your Q&As. When travelers ask for complete itineraries ("wine tour weekend with dining and accommodation"), you get recommended together.</p>

            <h3>Honest Positioning</h3>
            <p>We help you articulate what you actually are. Big operation perfect for tour buses? We say that. Intimate and exclusive? We say that. AI recommends you when positioning matches what travelers want.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Why It Works</h2>
            <p>AI systems prefer recommending complete experiences over isolated businesses. When your content references a partner restaurant or hotel, queries like "wine tour weekend in Barossa with dining and accommodation" trigger bundled recommendations.</p>
            <p>We supplement SEO, not replace it. Partner references create cross-links that improve Google rankings. Network referrals generate real bookings. AI visibility is the bonus.</p>
