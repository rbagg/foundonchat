            <h2>Australia’s First Tourism AI Optimisation Agency</h2>
            <p>In 2025, travellers rely on AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity to plan their trips. But most Australian tourism businesses—wineries, restaurants, accommodations, and tour operators—are invisible to these AI systems and struggle to rank on Google. FoundOnChat changes that.</p>
            <p>We’re Australia’s first dedicated AI optimisation agency, helping your business get recommended when travellers ask questions like “Best winery in Barossa Valley” or “Top restaurants in Melbourne CBD.” Our unique Network Effects strategy connects your business with local partners to create a powerful ecosystem, boosting your visibility on AI chatbots and Google, driving more bookings.</p>
            <p>Refer a partner to our Network Partnership plan and save up to 30% on fees. <a href="contact.html">Take the First Step</a> with a free 30-minute AI and SEO audit.</p>

            <h2>Why Network Effects?</h2>
            <p>Our Network Effects strategy is the key to standing out in 2025. By partnering your business (e.g., a winery) with complementary local businesses (e.g., restaurants, hotels), we create a self-reinforcing loop where AI chatbots and search engines recommend your group as a complete experience. For example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A traveller asks ChatGPT, “Plan a wine tour in Margaret River with dining and accommodation.” Our network ensures your winery, a partner restaurant, and a nearby hotel are recommended together.</li>
                <li>Cross-linked content and llms.txt files signal authority to AI and Google, improving rankings by 20-30% (based on 2024 client data).</li>
                <li>Shared marketing reduces costs, with networked businesses seeing 15% higher group bookings (Tourism Australia, 2024).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Join our Network Partnership plan ($99/month per business, minimum 3 businesses) and amplify your reach. Refer partners to save 10% per referral, up to 30% off.</p>
