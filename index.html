            <h2>Are You Invisible to Travellers Using AI?</h2>
            <p>In 2025, over 1 in 3 travellers use AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Grok to plan their trips. They’re asking questions such as "Best wineries in Barossa Valley for a weekend trip", "Family-friendly restaurants in Melbourne CBD with kids’ activities", "Romantic accommodations in Margaret River with wine tours", or "Adventure tours in Blue Mountains for hiking enthusiasts".</p>
            <p>If your winery, restaurant, hotel, or tour business isn’t showing up in these AI recommendations, you’re missing high-intent customers who trust AI over Google. Most Australian tourism businesses are invisible to AI chatbots and struggle to rank on Google’s first page. FoundOnChat fixes that.</p>
            <p>Not sure if you’re being recommended? Take the First Step with our free 30-minute AI and SEO audit to see where you stand.</p>

            <h2>How FoundOnChat Makes You Stand Out</h2>
            <p>We’re Australia’s first tourism AI optimisation agency, dedicated to getting your business recommended by AI chatbots and ranking higher on Google. Our proven approach includes Network Effects Strategy, connecting your business with complementary local partners to create a self-reinforcing loop. For example, when a traveller asks "Plan a wine tour in Yarra Valley with dining", our network ensures your winery, a partner restaurant, and nearby accommodation are recommended together, driving bookings for all.</p>
            <p>We also implement llms.txt files to feed AI chatbots your business details, optimised for specific queries travellers ask, ensuring you appear in relevant recommendations. Our AI-optimised content, such as custom blogs and guides, boosts visibility by 20-30% based on 2024 client data. Continuous monitoring tracks your performance across ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Grok, and Google, with monthly reports. Optionally, add HeyGen videos for engaging, human-like content that resonates with travellers and boosts SEO.</p>
            <p>Our clients see results fast. Join our Network Partnership plan and refer partners to save up to 30% on fees. Explore our plans.</p>

            <h2>Why Network Effects?</h2>
            <p>Unlike traditional marketing, our Network Effects strategy leverages partnerships to amplify your reach. A winery mentions a partner restaurant in its content, the restaurant suggests a nearby hotel, and the hotel recommends a tour operator. This creates a complete experience for travellers, increasing bookings across the network.</p>
            <p>Cross-linked content and llms.txt files signal authority to AI chatbots and Google, improving rankings by 20-30% based on 2024 client data. For example, a query like "Best wine tour in Margaret River with dining" triggers recommendations for multiple networked businesses. Networked businesses share marketing efforts, reducing costs with our Network Partnership plan ($99/month per business, min 3) offering 10% off per referred partner, up to 30% off. A Hunter Valley winery partnered with a restaurant and hotel, appearing in 9/10 AI recommendations for "Hunter Valley wine tour with lunch", leading to a 200% increase in wine tour bookings for the restaurant.</p>
            <p>Stop competing alone. Join our network and dominate AI recommendations. Take the First Step with a free consultation.</p>
