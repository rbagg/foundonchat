            <h2>Customers are Searching on ChatGPT</h2>
            <p>When tourists ask ChatGPT "Best wineries in Barossa Valley" or Claude "Where to stay near Uluru", do you show up?</p>
            <p>1 in 3 travellers use AI to plan trips. They’re asking ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Grok for help planning what to eat, where to stay, and what to do.</p>
            <p>Most businesses are invisible. You're missing high-intent customers who trust ChatGPT over Google. Our Network Effects strategy solves this, boosting both AI visibility and SEO.</p>

            <h2>Network Effects: Your Competitive Edge</h2>
            <p>Our unique Network Effects strategy connects your business with local partners (e.g., wineries, restaurants, hotels) to boost visibility on AI chatbots and Google. When a tourist asks, "Best wine tasting in Hunter Valley with lunch," our network ensures AI recommends a full experience—your winery, a partner restaurant, and nearby accommodation—driving bookings for all and improving SEO through referral links.</p>
            <p>Join our Network Partnership plan and refer partners to save up to 30% on fees. <a href="pricing.html">See Pricing</a>.</p>
