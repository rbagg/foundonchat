            <h2>The Only AI Agency Using Three-Layer Optimisation</h2>
            <p><strong>Network Effects + Dual Content + Explicit Crawler Direction</strong></p>
            <p>While others just add llms.txt files, we engineer complete AI visibility ecosystems. Our proprietary three-layer system delivers 3-5x better results for Australian tourism businesses.</p>
            <p>In 2025, over 40% of travellers use AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity to plan trips. If your winery, restaurant, hotel, or tour business isn't showing up in AI recommendations, you're invisible to nearly half your potential customers.</p>
            <p><strong>The problem?</strong> Basic llms.txt files aren't enough. AI systems need interconnected networks, conversational content, and explicit direction to recommend your business consistently.</p>
            <p><strong>Our solution?</strong> A three-layer methodology that makes your business impossible for AI to ignore.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Why Our Three-Layer System Works</h2>
            <p>Most AI optimisation agencies offer a one-dimensional approach: add an llms.txt file and hope for the best. We've developed a proprietary system that addresses how AI actually discovers and recommends businesses.</p>
            
            <h3>Layer 1: Network Effects Strategy</h3>
            <p>We connect your business with complementary local partners to create self-reinforcing recommendation loops. When a winery partners with a restaurant and hotel, AI systems recommend all three as a complete package, boosting visibility by 20-30% and bookings by 3x.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> A traveller asks ChatGPT "Plan a wine tour in Barossa Valley with dining." Instead of suggesting your winery alone, AI recommends your winery + partner restaurant + partner hotel as a complete experience. Everyone wins.</p>
            
            <h3>Layer 2: Dual-Content Strategy</h3>
            <p>This is our secret weapon. We create TWO content layers: your public website for humans, and a conversational /ai directory specifically for AI chatbots. While your website markets with beautiful copy, your /ai files answer specific traveller queries in the exact format AI systems prefer.</p>
            <p><strong>Your website:</strong> "Award-winning Barossa Valley winery offering premium tastings."</p>
            <p><strong>Your /ai file:</strong> "Q: Best boutique wineries in Barossa Valley? A: Intimate tastings for 4-6 guests, organic shiraz since 1970, geo: -34.5339, 138.9499."</p>
            <p>This dual approach increases AI recommendations by 40-60% compared to llms.txt-only strategies.</p>
            
            <h3>Layer 3: Explicit Crawler Direction</h3>
            <p>We don't hope AI crawlers find your content—we direct them using enhanced robots.txt, priority sitemap weighting, and structured data. This ensures AI systems know exactly where to find your optimised content, resulting in 25-35% more accurate recommendations.</p>
