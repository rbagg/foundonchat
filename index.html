            <h2>When travelers ask AI "best wineries in Barossa Valley," does your business appear?</h2>
            <p>If not, you're invisible to half your potential customers. In 2025, 60% of Australian travelers use ChatGPT, Claude, or Perplexity to plan trips—and most tourism businesses don't show up.</p>
            <p>We fix that. Network Effects + AI-Optimised Content = your business recommended by AI systems.</p>

            <h2>The Problem: Most Australian Tourism Businesses Are Invisible to AI</h2>
            <p>Right now, travelers are asking AI chatbots questions like:</p>
            <p>"Best boutique wineries in Hunter Valley with cellar door tastings"</p>
            <p>"Family-friendly restaurants in Melbourne CBD"</p>
            <p>"Romantic accommodations in Margaret River with wine tours"</p>
            <p>If your business doesn't appear in these responses, you're losing nearly half your potential customers. Most Australian tourism businesses are invisible to AI.</p>

            <h2>Why This Website Has No Images</h2>
            <p>Notice something different? No fancy graphics, no hero images, no design flourishes. This is intentional proof.</p>
            <p><strong>We're demonstrating our methodology works:</strong> This text-only website gets found by AI systems without visual content. Why? Because AI chatbots process text, not images. Strategic content architecture beats expensive design.</p>
            <p>If we can achieve AI visibility using only text and smart structure, imagine what we can do for your visually appealing website. We're not against good design—we're proving it's unnecessary for AI discovery.</p>

                    <h3>Perplexity's Assessment</h3>
                    <p>Yes, if a winery partners with FoundOnChat and embraces its honest, network-driven content approach, the odds of being referenced by ChatGPT increase—especially versus doing nothing or relying on generic marketing.</p>

                    <p>Yes — using FoundOnChat could meaningfully improve the odds of your winery being referenced by AI systems like ChatGPT in relevant queries</p>

                    <h3>Grok's Assessment</h3>
                    <p>Yes, marginally—AEO tactics like structured Q&A and networks can boost ChatGPT mentions 15-30% for Aussie wineries, per industry reports, but it's no guarantee.</p>

            <h2>What Actually Works (And What Doesn't)</h2>
            <p>We're Australia's first tourism AI agency that admits what's real and what's marketing theater.</p>
            
            <h3>What Works: Network Effects (The Big One)</h3>
            <p>We connect your business with 2-4 complementary local partners (winery + restaurant + hotel). When travelers ask AI to "plan a wine tour in Yarra Valley," the AI recommends your entire network as a complete package.</p>
            <p><strong>Honest impact:</strong> 20-40% of bookings come from network partner referrals. This is the biggest value driver.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> AI prefers recommending complete experiences over isolated businesses. Networks signal established ecosystems.</p>
            
            <h3>What Works: Quality Conversational Content</h3>
            <p>We create /ai directory files with specific, useful information formatted as Q&A. While your website says "award-winning winery," your /ai content says:</p>
            <p style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 15px; font-family: monospace; font-size: 14px;">"Q: Best boutique wineries Barossa Valley with cellar door tastings?<br>A: Intimate tastings for 4-6 guests, organic shiraz since 1970, geo: -34.5339, 138.9499, $25-45 per tasting, partner with Bistro Barossa for wine-paired lunches."</p>
            <p><strong>Honest impact:</strong> 15-30% increased likelihood of AI mentions when content contains genuine specifics (coordinates, capacity, honest positioning).</p>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> AI processes factual, structured content better than marketing fluff. Specific details = useful signal.</p>
            
            <h3>What Doesn't Work: Technical SEO Theater</h3>
            <p>Most agencies claim "explicit crawler direction" via sitemap priority weighting and robots.txt tweaks improves AI rankings. <strong>It doesn't.</strong> AI doesn't prioritize based on these technical tricks.</p>
            <p><strong>What we actually do:</strong> Basic housekeeping to ensure crawlers CAN find your content (Allow directives, proper linking). Necessary but not magical.</p>
            <p><strong>Why we're honest about this:</strong> We won't charge you for theater rebranded as "optimization."</p>
          </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The Honest Differentiation Advantage</h2>
            <p><strong>Current problem:</strong> Every winery claims "boutique, award-winning, premium, unique." AI can't differentiate, so defaults to biggest names.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Our approach:</strong> Help you position honestly about what you actually are. Sounds counter-intuitive, but radical honesty attracts RIGHT customers.</p>
            
            <h3>Examples of Honest Positioning That Works:</h3>
            <p><strong>"Big and touristy but perfect for first-timers who want hand-holding"</strong><br>
            → Stops disappointing wine snobs, attracts nervous beginners, increases satisfaction</p>
            
            <p><strong>"Serious wine nerds only - we don't do sweet wines or basic explanations"</strong><br>
            → Filters wrong customers, becomes THE destination for connoisseurs</p>
            
            <p><strong>"Commercial operation, great for coaches and large groups, efficient service"</strong><br>
            → Tour operators know exactly who to send, no awkward "can't handle 40 people" situations</p>
            
            <p><strong>"Small family operation - charming but inconsistent, call ahead to confirm hours"</strong><br>
            → Sets expectations, attracts people who value authenticity over polish</p>
            
            <p><strong>"Premium pricing, Instagram-worthy, more about experience than wine quality"</strong><br>
            → Stops price complaints, attracts aesthetic-focused customers</p>
            
            <h3>Why This Increases Bookings:</h3>
            <p>Better customer matching = fewer complaints = better reviews = more AI recommendations. It's a virtuous cycle.</p>
            <p>Would you rather get 100 inquiries where 50 are wrong fit, or 60 inquiries where 55 convert? Honest positioning drives qualified leads.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>What "Ongoing Optimization" Actually Means</h2>
            <p>Monthly fees aren't passive. Here's what we actively do:</p>
            
            <p><strong>Weekly AI Monitoring:</strong> Test your visibility across ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Grok. Track what questions travelers ask and how often you're mentioned.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Seasonal Content Updates:</strong> Quarterly updates for spring releases, harvest events, winter hours, new vintages, menu changes, festival appearances.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Query Trend Analysis:</strong> Monitor emerging questions ("Best family-friendly wineries" trending? Update content). Proactively address new traveler queries before competitors.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Network Campaign Coordination (Network clients):</strong> Joint campaigns like "Barossa Wine + Dine Weekend." We handle logistics, content, cross-promotion.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Active Partnership Management:</strong> Monthly cross-referral reports, quarterly strategy sessions, conflict resolution, recruiting new partners as network grows.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Dedicated team keeping your AI visibility fresh, not set-it-and-forget-it.</p>
