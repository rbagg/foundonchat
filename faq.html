    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <p>Honest answers to common questions about AI optimisation for tourism businesses.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>General Questions</h2>
    
    <h3>What exactly does FoundOnChat do?</h3>
    <p>We help Australian tourism businesses get recommended by AI systems like ChatGPT.</p>
    <p>Two-part approach: Network Effects (connecting complementary businesses) + AI-Optimised Content (monthly Q&A updates).</p>
    <p>We supplement SEO, not replace it.</p>
    <p>Better Google rankings, network referrals, and AI visibility together.</p>

    <h3>How is this different from regular SEO?</h3>
    <p>SEO optimises for Google's algorithm.</p>
    <p>We optimise for conversational AI systems that answer natural language queries.</p>
    <p>Key differences: Conversational Q&A format (not keyword-stuffed).</p>
    <p>Network validation signals (not just backlinks).</p>
    <p>Honest positioning (not aspirational marketing copy).</p>
    <p>Bonus: Our approach improves SEO too through partner cross-links and quality content.</p>

    <h3>Do I need good reviews first?</h3>
    <p>Yes. Minimum 3.5 stars average.</p>
    <p>AI systems reference review data when making recommendations.</p>
    <p>If you're below 3.5 stars, fix quality issues first.</p>
    <p>We can't market you out of bad service.</p>
    <p>Once reviews improve, come back to us.</p>
    <p>We'll help you get the visibility you deserve.</p>

    <h3>How long until I see results?</h3>
    <p>Setup: 3-4 weeks. Initial AI indexing: 30-60 days.</p>
    <p>Noticeable results: 60-90 days. Best results: 6-12 months.</p>
    <p>AI systems need time to index content.</p>
    <p>Network effects compound gradually. Not overnight magic.</p>

    <h3>What if I don't have network partners?</h3>
    <p>Individual plan includes partner identification and outreach templates.</p>
    <p>We show you who to contact and how.</p>
    <p>Network Partnership plan (3+ businesses): We coordinate everything and manage relationships.</p>
    <p>Even without formal networks, we reference complementary businesses in your content.</p>
    <p>Still effective.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Pricing & Plans</h2>
    
    <h3>Why month-to-month instead of contracts?</h3>
    <p>We earn your business monthly.</p>
    <p>If we're not delivering value, you shouldn't pay.</p>
    <p>Reality check: Best results after 6+ months as network effects compound.</p>
    <p>But we won't lock you in.</p>

    <h3>What's the 90-day guarantee?</h3>
    <p>If no measurable improvement in 90 days, you choose:</p>
    <p>(A) We work free until results show, or (B) Full refund.</p>
    <p>"Measurable improvement" = increased AI mention rate, better positioning, improved recommendation quality.</p>
    <p>We document baseline in free audit. Track weekly.</p>
    <p>You see exactly what's improving.</p>

    <h3>Can I start with Individual and upgrade to Network?</h3>
    <p>Yes. Many clients start Individual, then form networks once they see results.</p>
    <p>We handle the transition. No setup fees.</p>
    <p>Just switch to Network pricing ($99/month per business).</p>

    <h3>What if I want to cancel?</h3>
    <p>Cancel anytime. No penalties.</p>
    <p>You keep all content we created for your site.</p>
    <p>We'll even help transition to managing it yourself if you want to continue the approach.</p>

<section>
    <h2>Technical Questions</h2>
    
    <h3>Do you need access to my website?</h3>
    <p>Yes. We need to add files to your site (/ai directory and llms.txt).</p>
    <p>Usually just FTP/SFTP access.</p>
    <p>Or we provide files and your developer uploads them.</p>
    <p>We don't change your existing pages.</p>
    <p>Just add new AI-optimised content.</p>

    <h3>Will this mess up my current SEO?</h3>
    <p>No. We add content, don't change existing pages.</p>
    <p>New content improves SEO through partner cross-links.</p>
    <p>We follow Google's guidelines. No black-hat tricks.</p>
    <p>No penalties risk.</p>

    <h3>What if I already have an llms.txt file?</h3>
    <p>Perfect! We'll enhance it.</p>
    <p>Add network partner references and point to your /ai content.</p>
    <p>Many clients have basic llms.txt when they come to us.</p>
    <p>We make it work harder.</p>

    <h3>Do I need a developer?</h3>
    <p>Helpful but not required.</p>
    <p>We can provide files for your developer to upload.</p>
    <p>Or if you have basic FTP access, we can guide you through it.</p>
    <p>Not complicated.</p>

    <h3>What platforms do you optimise for?</h3>
    <p>ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Grok, and other AI systems.</p>
    <p>We test across all major platforms weekly.</p>
    <p>Different AI systems have different strengths.</p>
    <p>We optimise for all of them together.</p>

    <h2>Content & Strategy</h2>
    
    <h3>What's "honest positioning"?</h3>
    <p>Articulating what you actually are, not what you wish you were.</p>
    <p>Example: Big commercial winery? We say "perfect for tour groups of 20-50," not "intimate boutique."</p>
    <p>Why? AI recommends you when positioning matches what travellers want.</p>
    <p>Better customer fit means happier visitors.</p>

    <h3>Won't this hurt my premium brand image?</h3>
    <p>No. Honest doesn't mean downmarket. It means accurate.</p>
    <p>If you're genuinely boutique and intimate, we say that.</p>
    <p>If you're large and commercial, we say that.</p>
    <p>Premium is about quality and positioning match, not false claims.</p>

    <h3>How do you track trending queries?</h3>
    <p>We monitor what travellers actually ask AI systems.</p>
    <p>Test variations weekly. Track which queries trigger your business.</p>
    <p>Then create content targeting those queries.</p>
    <p>Examples: "organic shiraz tastings under $50," "kid-friendly wineries Barossa."</p>
    <p>Not set-it-and-forget-it. Monthly updates keep you relevant.</p>

    <h3>Can I see content before it goes live?</h3>
    <p>Yes. We share all content for approval.</p>
    <p>You have final say.</p>
    <p>Usually 1-2 rounds of revisions.</p>
    <p>Most clients approve quickly once they see the conversational format.</p>

    <h3>What if I disagree with your positioning recommendation?</h3>
    <p>We'll work with you.</p>
    <p>But if positioning fundamentally mismatches reality, we'll be honest about limitations.</p>
    <p>Example: If you're a large commercial winery insisting on "intimate boutique" positioning, we'll explain why AI won't recommend you that way.</p>
    <p>Sometimes we're not the right fit. Better to know upfront.</p>

    <h2>Results & Expectations</h2>
    
    <h3>What's a realistic improvement?</h3>
    <p>Typical: Noticeable increase in mention rates for relevant queries.</p>
    <p>Some businesses see more, some less.</p>
    <p>Depends on: Business quality (reviews matter).</p>
    <p>Regional competition. Honest positioning execution.</p>
    <p>Network participation.</p>
    <p>We give honest projections in your free audit, not guarantees.</p>

    <h3>Can you guarantee AI recommendations?</h3>
    <p>No. AI responses are probabilistic, not guaranteed.</p>
    <p>We can improve odds significantly, but can't control AI systems.</p>
    <p>What we can guarantee: Quality content. Network coordination.</p>
    <p>Weekly monitoring. Honest effort.</p>
    <p>90-day guarantee covers measurable improvement in mention rates and positioning.</p>

    <h3>What about businesses in competitive regions?</h3>
    <p>Competition matters but isn't everything.</p>
    <p>Honest positioning helps you stand out.</p>
    <p>Example: Barossa Valley has 80+ wineries.</p>
    <p>But most position identically. Honest positioning differentiates.</p>
    <p>Network effects help too.</p>
    <p>If you're part of a validated network, AI prefers recommending you.</p>

    <h3>Will I rank #1 for my category?</h3>
    <p>Maybe, maybe not. AI systems vary recommendations.</p>
    <p>No permanent #1 position.</p>
    <p>Goal: Appear consistently in relevant queries with accurate positioning.</p>
    <p>Better than chasing #1 with poor customer match.</p>

    <h3>What if my competitors also optimise?</h3>
    <p>Good! Raises quality for entire region.</p>
    <p>AI systems prefer regions with clear, honest information.</p>
    <p>Competition is about differentiation, not elimination.</p>
    <p>Honest positioning helps you stand out regardless.</p>
