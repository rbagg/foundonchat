        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions - AI Visibility Partners</h1>

        <section>
            <h2>General Questions</h2>

            <h3>What exactly is AI visibility optimization?</h3>
            <p>AI visibility optimization is the process of structuring your business information and content so that AI assistants like ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity can easily discover, understand, and recommend your business to their users.</p>
            <p>Think of it as SEO for the age of AI - instead of optimizing for Google's search algorithm, we optimize for how AI systems process and reference business information.</p>

            <h3>How is this different from traditional SEO?</h3>
            <p>Traditional SEO focuses on ranking websites in search engine results pages. AI optimization focuses on getting your business mentioned and recommended within AI assistant conversations.</p>
            <p>The key differences:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>AI systems prefer structured, factual information over keyword-optimized content</li>
                <li>Conversational queries matter more than search terms</li>
                <li>Freshness and accuracy are weighted more heavily</li>
                <li>Local context and authority signals work differently</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Which AI platforms do you optimize for?</h3>
            <p>We optimize for all major AI assistants including ChatGPT (OpenAI), Claude (Anthropic), Perplexity, Google's Bard/Gemini, and Microsoft's Copilot.</p>
            <p>Our approach creates content that works well across all platforms rather than targeting specific systems.</p>

            <h3>How long does it take to see results?</h3>
            <p>Most clients see initial improvements in AI mentions within 30-45 days. Significant, consistent results typically appear within 60-90 days.</p>
            <p>The timeline depends on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your industry's competitiveness</li>
                <li>Current online presence quality</li>
                <li>How often AI systems crawl your content</li>
                <li>Local vs. national market focus</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Technical Questions</h2>

            <h3>What is an llms.txt file?</h3>
            <p>An llms.txt file is a new web standard that provides AI systems with structured information about your business. It acts like a roadmap, telling AI assistants exactly where to find your most important business information.</p>
            <p>Think of it like a robots.txt file, but designed specifically for AI systems rather than traditional search engines.</p>

            <h3>Do you modify our existing website?</h3>
            <p>We typically add new pages and files to your website rather than modifying existing content. This includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Adding an llms.txt file to your website root</li>
                <li>Creating new AI-optimized pages (like FAQ or local guides)</li>
                <li>Adding structured data markup where beneficial</li>
                <li>Setting up analytics tracking</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Your existing website design and content remain unchanged unless you specifically request modifications.</p>

            <h3>Is this safe for our current SEO?</h3>
            <p>Absolutely. Our AI optimization techniques complement traditional SEO rather than conflicting with it. The structured content and comprehensive information we create often improves traditional search rankings as well.</p>
            <p>We follow white-hat optimization practices and never engage in manipulative tactics that could harm your search visibility.</p>

            <h3>How do you measure success?</h3>
            <p>We track several key metrics:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mention frequency:</strong> How often AI assistants reference your business</li>
                <li><strong>Context quality:</strong> Whether mentions are positive, neutral, or negative</li>
                <li><strong>Competitive positioning:</strong> Your mention frequency vs. competitors</li>
                <li><strong>Traffic attribution:</strong> Website visitors referred by AI assistants</li>
                <li><strong>Business impact:</strong> Inquiries and bookings attributed to AI discovery</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Monthly reports show trends in all these areas with clear explanations of what the data means for your business.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Service Questions</h2>

            <h3>What industries do you work with?</h3>
            <p>We work with service-based businesses across industries including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hospitality (hotels, restaurants, tourism)</li>
                <li>Professional services (medical, dental, legal, consulting)</li>
                <li>Local services (contractors, repair services, wellness)</li>
                <li>Retail and e-commerce</li>
                <li>Real estate and property management</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Our approach adapts to each industry's specific optimization needs and customer behavior patterns.</p>

            <h3>Do you work with businesses outside Australia?</h3>
            <p>Yes, we work with English-speaking businesses globally. However, our deepest expertise is in Australian markets, local regulations, and cultural context.</p>
            <p>For international clients, we adapt our localization strategies to their specific geographic markets and cultural contexts.</p>

            <h3>What if we're not happy with the results?</h3>
            <p>We offer a 90-day satisfaction guarantee. If you're not seeing measurable improvements in AI visibility within 90 days, we'll continue working at no additional charge until you see results, or provide a full refund of monthly service fees.</p>
            <p>Our setup fees cover the work completed during implementation and are non-refundable, but all ongoing monthly fees are covered by our satisfaction guarantee.</p>

            <h3>Can we cancel anytime?</h3>
            <p>Yes, our ongoing services are month-to-month with 30 days notice for cancellation. There are no long-term contracts or cancellation fees.</p>
            <p>However, AI optimization is most effective as an ongoing strategy. Results typically improve significantly after 6+ months of consistent optimization.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Pricing Questions</h2>

            <h3>Why are setup fees separate from monthly fees?</h3>
            <p>Setup fees cover the intensive initial work: auditing your current presence, creating new content, implementing technical changes, and establishing monitoring systems.</p>
            <p>Monthly fees cover ongoing optimization: content updates, monitoring, reporting, and strategy adjustments. This pricing model ensures you're only paying for active work being performed.</p>

            <h3>Are there any hidden costs?</h3>
            <p>No hidden costs. Our quoted prices include everything needed for your service level:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>All content creation and optimization</li>
                <li>Technical implementation</li>
                <li>Monthly monitoring and reporting</li>
                <li>Email support and consultation</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The only additional costs would be optional add-ons that you specifically request, which we'd quote separately and get approval for in advance.</p>

            <h3>Do you offer payment plans?</h3>
            <p>Yes, we offer flexible payment options:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Full payment discount (5% off total annual cost)</li>
                <li>Quarterly payment plans</li>
                <li>Monthly payment plans</li>
                <li>Extended payment terms for setup fees (3-6 months)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We work with businesses to find payment arrangements that fit their cash flow needs.</p>
