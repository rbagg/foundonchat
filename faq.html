<section class="faq-section">
    <h2>General Questions</h2>
    
    <details>
        <summary><h3>What exactly does FoundOnChat do?</h3></summary>
        <p>We help Australian tourism businesses get recommended by AI systems like ChatGPT.</p>
        <p><strong>Two-part approach:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Network Effects (partner networks that get bundled recommendations):</strong> Connect complementary businesses</li>
            <li><strong>AI-Optimised Content:</strong> Monthly Q&A updates</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We supplement SEO, not replace it. Better Google rankings, network referrals, and AI visibility together.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary><h3>How is this different from regular SEO?</h3></summary>
        <p>SEO optimises for Google's algorithm. We optimise for conversational AI systems that answer natural language queries.</p>
        <p><strong>Key differences:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Conversational Q&A format (not keyword-stuffed)</li>
            <li>Network validation signals (not just backlinks)</li>
            <li>Honest positioning (not aspirational marketing copy)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Bonus:</strong> Our approach improves SEO too through partner cross-links and quality content.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary><h3>Do I need good reviews first?</h3></summary>
        <p>Yes. Minimum 3.5 stars average. AI systems reference review data when making recommendations.</p>
        <p>If you're below 3.5 stars, fix quality issues first. We can't market you out of bad service.</p>
        <p>Once reviews improve, come back—we'll help you get the visibility you deserve.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary><h3>How long until I see results?</h3></summary>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Setup:</strong> 3-4 weeks</li>
            <li><strong>Initial AI indexing:</strong> 30-60 days</li>
            <li><strong>Noticeable results:</strong> 60-90 days</li>
            <li><strong>Best results:</strong> 6-12 months</li>
        </ul>
        <p>AI systems need time to index content. Network Effects (partner networks that get bundled recommendations) compound gradually. Not overnight magic.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary><h3>What if I don't have network partners?</h3></summary>
        <p><strong>Individual plan:</strong> Includes partner identification and outreach templates. We show you who to contact and how.</p>
        <p><strong>Network Partnership plan (3+ businesses):</strong> We coordinate everything and manage relationships.</p>
        <p>Even without formal networks, we reference complementary businesses in your content. Still effective.</p>
    </details>

<section class="faq-section">
    <h2>Pricing & Plans</h2>
    
    <details>
        <summary><h3>Why month-to-month instead of contracts?</h3></summary>
        <p>We earn your business monthly. If we're not delivering value, you shouldn't pay.</p>
        <p><strong>Reality check:</strong> Best results after 6+ months as Network Effects (partner networks that get bundled recommendations) compound. But we won't lock you in.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary><h3>What's the 90-day guarantee?</h3></summary>
        <p>If no measurable improvement in 90 days, you choose:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>(A)</strong> We work free until results show, or</li>
            <li><strong>(B)</strong> Full refund</li>
        </ul>
        <p>"Measurable improvement" = increased AI mention rate, better positioning, improved recommendation quality.</p>
        <p>We document baseline in free audit. Track weekly. You see exactly what's improving.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary><h3>Can I start with Individual and upgrade to Network?</h3></summary>
        <p>Yes. Many clients start Individual, then form networks once they see results.</p>
        <p>We handle the transition. No setup fees. Just switch to Network pricing ($99/month per business).</p>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary><h3>What if I want to cancel?</h3></summary>
        <p>Cancel anytime. No penalties.</p>
        <p>You keep all content we created for your site. We'll even help transition to managing it yourself if you want to continue the approach.</p>
    </details>

    <h2>Technical Questions</h2>
    
    <details>
        <summary><h3>Do you need access to my website?</h3></summary>
        <p>Yes. We need to add files to your site (/ai directory and llms.txt). Usually just FTP/SFTP access.</p>
        <p>Or we provide files and your developer uploads them. We don't change your existing pages—just add new AI-optimised content.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary><h3>Will this mess up my current SEO?</h3></summary>
        <p>No. We add content, don't change existing pages. New content improves SEO through partner cross-links.</p>
        <p>We follow Google's guidelines. No black-hat tricks. No penalties risk.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary><h3>What if I already have an llms.txt file?</h3></summary>
        <p>Perfect! We'll enhance it—add network partner references and point to your /ai content.</p>
        <p>Many clients have basic llms.txt when they come to us. We make it work harder.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary><h3>Do I need a developer?</h3></summary>
        <p>Helpful but not required. We can provide files for your developer to upload, or if you have basic FTP access, we can guide you through it. Not complicated.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary><h3>What platforms do you optimise for?</h3></summary>
        <p>ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Grok, and other AI systems. We test across all major platforms weekly.</p>
        <p>Different AI systems have different strengths. We optimise for all of them together.</p>
    </details>

<section class="faq-section">
    <h2>Content & Strategy</h2>
    
    <details>
        <summary><h3>What's "honest positioning"?</h3></summary>
        <p>Articulating what you actually are, not what you wish you were.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Big commercial winery? We say "perfect for tour groups of 20-50," not "intimate boutique."</p>
        <p><strong>Why?</strong> AI recommends you when positioning matches what travellers want. Better customer fit means happier visitors.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary><h3>Won't this hurt my premium brand image?</h3></summary>
        <p>No. Honest doesn't mean downmarket—it means accurate.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you're genuinely boutique and intimate, we say that</li>
            <li>If you're large and commercial, we say that</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Premium is about quality and positioning match, not false claims.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary><h3>How do you track trending queries?</h3></summary>
        <p>We monitor what travellers actually ask AI systems. Test variations weekly. Track which queries trigger your business.</p>
        <p>Then create content targeting those queries.</p>
        <p><strong>Examples:</strong> "organic shiraz tastings under $50," "kid-friendly wineries Barossa."</p>
        <p>Not set-it-and-forget-it. Monthly updates keep you relevant.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary><h3>Can I see content before it goes live?</h3></summary>
        <p>Yes. We share all content for approval. You have final say. Usually 1-2 rounds of revisions.</p>
        <p>Most clients approve quickly once they see the conversational format.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary><h3>What if I disagree with your positioning recommendation?</h3></summary>
        <p>We'll work with you. But if positioning fundamentally mismatches reality, we'll be honest about limitations.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> If you're a large commercial winery insisting on "intimate boutique" positioning, we'll explain why AI won't recommend you that way.</p>
        <p>Sometimes we're not the right fit. Better to know upfront.</p>
    </details>

    <h2>Results & Expectations</h2>
    
    <details>
        <summary><h3>What's a realistic improvement?</h3></summary>
        <p>From our audits: 85% of clients see 20-40% uplift in mention quality within 3 months.</p>
        <p><strong>Depends on:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Business quality (reviews matter—3.5+ stars)</li>
            <li>Regional competition</li>
            <li>Honest positioning execution</li>
            <li>Network participation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We give honest projections in your free audit, not guarantees.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary><h3>Can you guarantee AI recommendations?</h3></summary>
        <p>No. AI responses are probabilistic, not guaranteed. We can improve odds significantly, but can't control AI systems.</p>
        <p><strong>What we can guarantee:</strong> Quality content, network coordination, weekly monitoring, honest effort.</p>
        <p>90-day guarantee covers measurable improvement in mention rates and positioning.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary><h3>What about businesses in competitive regions?</h3></summary>
        <p>Competition matters but isn't everything. Honest positioning helps you stand out.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Barossa Valley has 80+ wineries, but most position identically. Honest positioning differentiates.</p>
        <p>Network Effects (partner networks that get bundled recommendations) help too—if you're part of a validated network, AI prefers recommending you.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary><h3>Will I rank #1 for my category?</h3></summary>
        <p>Maybe, maybe not. AI systems vary recommendations. No permanent #1 position.</p>
        <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Appear consistently in relevant queries with accurate positioning. Better than chasing #1 with poor customer match.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary><h3>What if my competitors also optimise?</h3></summary>
        <p>Good! Raises quality for entire region. AI systems prefer regions with clear, honest information.</p>
        <p>Competition is about differentiation, not elimination. Honest positioning helps you stand out regardless.</p>
