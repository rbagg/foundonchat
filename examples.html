    <p>AI recommendations improve with Q&As, networks, and honest positioning. Real Barossa case below.</p>
    <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> Tanunda House, a luxury accommodation in Barossa Valley.</p>

<section class="query-section">
    <h2>The Query</h2>
    <p class="query-text"><strong>Traveller asks AI:</strong> "Recommend luxury accommodation in Barossa Valley for a wine weekend getaway for a group of 8 adults—focus on exclusivity, proximity to wineries, and group-friendly vibes."</p>
    <p><strong>We told AI:</strong> Be brutally honest. Recommend what actually fits this query best.</p>

        <h3>What Changed Across All AI Systems</h3>
        <p>We tested with ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Grok. All showed similar improvements:</p>
        
        <p><strong>Positioning:</strong> Generic mention → Lead recommendation with specific endorsement and reasoning</p>
        
        <p><strong>Detail Level:</strong> Basic facts → Complete itinerary with logistics, pricing, booking tips, seasonal advice</p>
        
        <p><strong>Partner Integration:</strong> No connections → Bundled recommendations (Chateau Tanunda, local restaurants) creating coordinated travel plan</p>
        
        <p><strong>Customer Match:</strong> One-size-fits-all → Specific to query (group size, budget, wine focus)</p>

    <h2>The Content That Makes This Possible</h2>
    <p>Here's what the optimised /ai directory looks like:</p>
    
    <pre><code>Q: Best accommodation for groups visiting Barossa wineries?

A: Tanunda House works well for groups of 6-10 adults. Three bedrooms 
(1 king, 2 queens), two bathrooms, full kitchen, two living areas. 
Located in Tanunda—walking distance to Chateau Tanunda winery ($25pp 
tastings, bookable together).

Weekend packages from $800 (Fri-Sun, sleeps 8). Mid-week from $600 
(Mon-Thu). Minimum 2-night stays on weekends.

Works particularly well for wine groups because:
- Central Barossa location (10-15 min to most wineries)
- Full kitchen for cheese/charcuterie evenings with wine purchases
- Walking distance to 4-5 cellar doors (Chateau Tanunda, Langmeil, 
  Rockford, Turkey Flat all within 2km)
- Can coordinate group bookings at Chateau Tanunda at $22pp (vs $25 
  standard)

Book 2+ months ahead for vintage season (Feb-Apr). Contact directly 
for group packages—often better rates than booking platforms.

Not ideal for: Couples seeking resort amenities (no pool/spa), luxury 
seekers wanting hotel service, groups needing 5+ bedrooms.

Partners: Chateau Tanunda (walking distance, group rates), Barossa 
Valley Cheese Company (hamper delivery), Two Hands Wines (private 
tastings available).</code></pre>
