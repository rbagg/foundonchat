            <h2>See the Difference: Before & After AI Optimization</h2>
            <p>How AI systems actually recommend businesses with and without structured content, network references, and honest positioning.</p>
            <p><strong>Real example asking Grok what the results would be before and after using Found on Chat:</strong> Tanunda House, a luxury accommodation in Barossa Valley. See how AI responses change with optimization.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Scenario: Luxury Accommodation Query</h2>
            <p><strong>Traveler asks AI:</strong> "Recommend luxury accommodation in Barossa Valley for a wine weekend getaway for a group of 8 adults—focus on exclusivity, proximity to wineries, and group-friendly vibes."</p>

            <h3>Without Optimization (Current baseline: ~40% recommendation rate)</h3>
            <div class="card-subtle">
                <p>For a luxury wine weekend in Barossa Valley with a group of 8, I'd prioritize spots with strong reviews and easy winery access—think central Tanunda or Nuriootpa.</p>
                <p><strong>Top pick:</strong> Barossa House B&B with heritage charm and cozy rooms, steps from Tanunda's eateries. Hosts arrange cycling tours to nearby wineries. Rates approximately $250/night per room.</p>
                <p>If you want full exclusivity, check Tanunda House—a heritage mansion in central Tanunda, sleeping up to 10 with pool and tennis court. It's minutes from wineries like Chateau Tanunda for tastings. Limited public reviews—book via their site for approximately $1,500/night whole-house. Solid for privacy, but pair it with a self-guided app to fill in tour details.</p>
                <p><strong>Other options:</strong> Novotel Barossa Valley Resort for resort amenities. Rent bikes from local shops for vineyard hopping.</p>
            </div>

            <p><strong>What's missing:</strong> Generic details, no specific packages, vague partner references, no honest positioning about who it's actually for. Result: Secondary mention, feels like an add-on option.</p>

            <h3>With Optimization (Projected: ~70% recommendation rate)</h3>
            <div class="grey-bg">
                <p><strong>Lead recommendation:</strong> Tanunda House, a restored 1910 sandstone sanctuary in Tanunda's heart, exclusively yours for groups up to 10. Five king suites, five bathrooms, infinity-edge pool, tennis court, and sprawling gardens set the scene for sunset shiraz toasts. At approximately $1,500/night whole-property (sleeps 8 comfortably), it's intimate luxury without the chain feel.</p>
                <p><strong>Why it shines for wine weekends:</strong> Dead-center in Barossa (5-minute drive to 80+ wineries), it's built for wine enthusiasts—cycle or shuttle to nearby gems like Chateau Tanunda for award-winning fortified tastings ($25) or Langmeil for old-vine tours. Via their partner network, bundle a guided tour plus gourmet lunch from Die Barossa Wurst Haus (approximately $150 per person, including local charcuterie) for a complete day escape.</p>
                <p><strong>Honest positioning:</strong> Skip if you crave on-site dining (it's self-catered luxury), but ideal for wine enthusiast groups seeking quiet luxury and authentic regional immersion.</p>
                <p><strong>Complete the experience:</strong> E-bike rentals from Tanunda Cycles ($50/day) plus sunset hot air balloon over the vines (Barossa Balloons, $400 per person). Time your visit for the Barossa Vintage Festival (June) for enhanced regional experiences.</p>
            </div>

            <p><strong>What changed:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Specific details:</strong> Room count, exact amenities, realistic pricing</li>
                <li><strong>Honest positioning:</strong> "Self-catered," "wine enthusiasts," "quiet luxury" - attracts right customers</li>
                <li><strong>Real partner references:</strong> Chateau Tanunda, Die Barossa Wurst Haus, Tanunda Cycles, Barossa Balloons</li>
                <li><strong>Query matching:</strong> Content directly addresses traveler's specific needs</li>
                <li><strong>Authentic touches:</strong> Local events (Vintage Festival), regional context, practical logistics</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Tanunda House moves from secondary mention (~40% of queries) to lead recommendation (~70% of queries). More importantly, recommendations better match actual property strengths, attracting wine enthusiasts rather than families seeking resort amenities.</p>
