            <h2>Honest Pricing - No Inflated Promises</h2>
            <p>We're selective about clients. If your reviews are below 3.5 stars or you're not willing to position honestly, we'll tell you we're not a good fit. No point wasting your money or our time.</p>
            <p><strong>Realistic expectations:</strong> 15-30% increased AI visibility from quality content, 20-40% of bookings from network referrals. Ranges, not guarantees. Results depend on your product quality, competition, and region.</p>

                    <h3>Individual Business</h3>
                    <p><strong>$149/month + $99 setup fee</strong></p>
                    <p>For single businesses testing AI optimization before building a network.</p>
                    
                    <h4>What You Actually Get:</h4>
                    <p><strong>Network Opportunity Mapping:</strong> We identify 3-5 ideal partners in your area (even if you're not ready to recruit them yet)</p>
                    <p><strong>Quality Conversational Content:</strong> Custom /ai directory with 10-15 Q&A entries matching real traveler queries, with specific details (coordinates, capacity, honest positioning)</p>
                    <p><strong>Honest Differentiation Strategy:</strong> Help you articulate what you actually are vs. aspirational claims</p>
                    <p><strong>Weekly AI Monitoring:</strong> Test visibility across ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Grok - see how often you're mentioned</p>
                    <p><strong>Quarterly Seasonal Updates:</strong> Update content for harvest events, new vintages, menu changes, hour adjustments</p>
                    <p><strong>Query Trend Analysis:</strong> Monitor what questions travelers ask AI, update content proactively</p>
                    <p><strong>Technical Housekeeping:</strong> Basic robots.txt setup, llms.txt creation, making sure crawlers can find your content (not magic, just necessary)</p>

                    <p>✗ Bookings without good product (we optimize visibility, not wine quality)</p>
                    <p>✗ Guaranteed percentages (we show realistic ranges)</p>
                    <p>✗ Network referrals (that's the Network Partnership benefit)</p>
                    
                    <h4>Honest Expected Impact:</h4>

            <h2>Payment Options & Terms</h2>
            
            <h3>Payment Methods</h3>
            <p>Direct debit, credit card, or bank transfer. All major cards accepted.</p>
            
            <h3>Payment Schedules</h3>
            <p><strong>Monthly:</strong> Month-to-month, no long-term commitment</p>
            <p><strong>Quarterly:</strong> Pay every 3 months, small discount available</p>
            <p><strong>Annual:</strong> Pay upfront for 12 months, receive 5% discount</p>
            <p><strong>Setup Fee Payment Plan:</strong> Split $99 setup over 3-6 months if needed (Individual only)</p>
            
            <h3>Cancellation Policy</h3>
            <p>Month-to-month service, cancel anytime with 30 days notice. No penalties.</p>
            <p><strong>However:</strong> AI optimization shows best results after 6+ months as Network Effects compound. We recommend committing to at least two quarterly cycles.</p>
            
            <h3>What Happens If You Cancel Early?</h3>
            <p>You keep all content we created (/ai files, blog posts, llms.txt). Network partnerships remain (you just lose our coordination). No hostage-taking.</p>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            
            <p><strong>Q: Why is Network Partnership cheaper than Individual?</strong></p>
            <p>A: We can coordinate multiple businesses more efficiently than managing them separately. Plus, network effects deliver better results, so we can charge less while you get more value.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Q: What if a network partner cancels?</strong></p>
            <p>A: You lose the 10% referral discount for that partner but keep discounts from others. The remaining network continues. We'll help recruit a replacement if desired.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Q: Can I upgrade from Individual to Network later?</strong></p>
            <p>A: Yes! We'll waive your already-paid setup fee if you upgrade within 90 days. Your rate drops to $99/month and you start earning referral discounts.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Q: Do you guarantee specific booking increases?</strong></p>
            <p>A: No. We've seen 15-85% increases depending on product quality, region, competition, and whether you're solo vs. network. We show realistic ranges, not promises.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Q: What if I'm not happy after 90 days?</strong></p>
            <p>A: You choose: (1) We continue working free until you see results, or (2) We refund all monthly fees paid. Setup fees are non-refundable as work was completed.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Q: Will you work with any business?</strong></p>
            <p>A: No. We're selective. If your reviews are below 3.5 stars, fix quality first. If you're not willing to position honestly, we're not a fit. We optimize visibility for businesses that deserve to be found.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Q: What happens during the first 30 days?</strong></p>
            <p>A: Week 1-2: Partner coordination (if network), content creation begins. Week 2-3: /ai directory deployment, technical setup. Week 3-4: Testing and launch. Then 30-60 days for AI indexing.</p>
