            <h2>Payment Options</h2>
            <p>We offer flexible payment terms to fit your cash flow:</p>
            
            <h3>Monthly Payments</h3>
            <p>Pay month-to-month with no long-term commitment. Cancel anytime with 30 days notice.</p>
            
            <h3>Quarterly Payments</h3>

            <h3>Annual Payments</h3>
            <p>Pay upfront for 12 months and receive 5% discount on monthly fees.</p>
            
            <h3>Setup Fee Payment Plans</h3>
            <p>For Individual Business plan, we can split the $99 setup fee over 3-6 months if needed.</p>
            
            <h3>Accepted Payment Methods</h3>
            <p>Direct debit, credit card, or bank transfer. All major cards accepted.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            
            <h3>Why separate setup and monthly fees?</h3>
            <p>Setup covers initial work (creating /ai content, configuring robots.txt, building network partnerships). Monthly fees cover ongoing optimization, monitoring, and updates. Network Partnership waives setup because we spread that work across multiple businesses.</p>
            
            <h3>Are there any hidden costs?</h3>
            <p>No. All prices include everything in the plan description. Optional add-ons (HeyGen videos, extra blog posts) are quoted separately and completely optional.</p>
            
            <h3>What if I want to cancel?</h3>
            <p>You can cancel anytime with 30 days notice. No penalties or cancellation fees. However, AI optimization shows best results after 6+ months of consistent work, so we recommend giving it time to compound.</p>
            
            <h3>Can I upgrade from Individual to Network Partnership later?</h3>
            <p>Yes! We'll waive your setup fee if you upgrade within 90 days. Your monthly rate drops to $99/month and you get referral discounts for any partners you recruit.</p>
            
            <h3>How does the referral discount work exactly?</h3>
            <p>For each partner business you successfully refer to the Network Partnership plan, you receive 10% off your monthly fee (up to maximum 30% off). The discount applies as long as your referred partners remain active clients.</p>
            
            <h3>What happens if a network partner cancels?</h3>
            <p>If a partner you referred cancels, you lose that 10% referral discount but keep discounts from other referred partners. Your remaining network partners continue at their current rates. We'll help you recruit a replacement partner if desired.</p>
            
            <h3>Do you offer discounts for larger networks?</h3>
            <p>The referral discount system is our volume discount. A business that refers 3+ partners pays only $69.30/month—that's already 53% off our Individual rate. We don't offer additional bulk discounts beyond this.</p>
            
            <h3>What's included in the 90-day guarantee?</h3>
            <p>If you don't see measurable improvements in AI visibility within 90 days (more frequent mentions, better recommendation quality, or increased traffic from AI referrals), we'll either:</p>
            <p><strong>Option 1:</strong> Continue working at no additional monthly charge until you see results</p>
            <p><strong>Option 2:</strong> Refund all monthly service fees paid (setup fees are non-refundable as they cover completed work)</p>
            <p>You choose which option you prefer.</p>
