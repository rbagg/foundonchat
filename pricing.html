<section>
    <h2>Realistic Expectations</h2>
    
    <h3>Timeline</h3>
    <p>Setup: 3-4 weeks</p>
    <p>Initial indexing: 30-60 days</p>
    <p>Noticeable results: 60-90 days</p>
    <p>Best results: 6-12 months (network effects compound)</p>

    <h3>Typical Results</h3>
    <p>Mention rate improvement: 40% to 70% of relevant queries</p>
    <p>Better customer matching: Fewer mismatched inquiries</p>
    <p>Network referrals: Varies by region and partners</p>
    <p>SEO benefits: Improved rankings from partner cross-links</p>

    <h3>What We Can't Guarantee</h3>
    <p>AI recommendations are probabilistic, not guaranteed. Results vary by business quality, regional competition, and implementation.</p>
    <p>We can't fix bad reviews (below 3.5 stars) or fundamental quality issues. AI optimization amplifies what you are.</p>

    <h2>Why Month-to-Month?</h2>
    <p>Most agencies lock you into 6-12 month contracts. We don't.</p>
    <p>You can cancel anytime. No penalties. Keep all content we created.</p>
    <p>Why? We believe in earning your business monthly. If we're not delivering value, you shouldn't pay.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Reality check:</strong> Best results come after 6+ months as network effects compound. But we won't force you to commit upfront.</p>

<section>
    <h2>Network Partnership Discount</h2>
    <p>$99/month per business (vs $149 individual). Why the discount?</p>
    <p>Efficiency: Managing 3-5 businesses together is more efficient than individual clients.</p>
    <p>Better results: Networks generate stronger AI signals than isolated businesses.</p>
    <p>Shared benefit: When one partner wins, all partners benefit from cross-referrals.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Three-business network (winery + restaurant + hotel) = $297/month total vs $447 individual.</p>
    <p>Each business gets better results and pays less. Win-win.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>What's Not Included</h2>
    <p>Website redesign or development (we work with your existing site)</p>
    <p>Social media management</p>
    <p>Paid advertising management</p>
    <p>Photography or videography</p>
    <p>Google Business Profile optimization (though we recommend it)</p>
    
    <p>We focus exclusively on AI optimization through content and networks. This keeps costs down and results focused.</p>
