            <p><strong>There's been a clear shift in how consumers discover businesses.</strong> While traditional marketing agencies focuse primarily on SEO and social media, we recognized that Australians increasingly turn to chatbots like ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Grok for business recommendations.</p>            
            <p><strong>The gap we identified:</strong> Businesses with strong reputations were being overlooked by AI systems, losing high-intent customers.</p>
            <p><strong>We're not here to replace your marketing agency.</strong> We want to work with them to make sure you're being found whereever your customers are searching.</p>

            <h2>A single mission: Make small businesses visible to AI</h2>
            <p>We believe the best businesses deserve to be recommended, regardless of how customers search for services. Our mission is to bridge the gap between traditional marketing and AI-age visibility.</p>
