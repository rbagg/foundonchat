            <h2>About FoundOnChat</h2>
            <p>Travellers are turning to AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Grok to plan their Australian adventures, from Barossa Valley wineries to Great Ocean Road tours. But many tourism businesses—wineries, restaurants, accommodations, and tour operators—are invisible to these AI systems, missing out on high-intent customers.</p>
            <p>At FoundOnChat, we’re Australia’s first tourism AI optimisation agency, dedicated to making your business stand out where travellers are searching.</p>

            <h2>Our Mission: Make Tourism Businesses AI-Visible</h2>
            <p>We believe every great winery, restaurant, hotel, or tour operator deserves to be recommended by AI. Our mission is to bridge the gap between traditional tourism marketing (SEO, social media) and AI-driven discovery, ensuring your business is found by travellers asking, “Best wine tours in Hunter Valley” or “Family-friendly stays in Blue Mountains.”</p>

            <h2>Our Unique Approach</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Network Effects Strategy</strong>: We connect your business with local partners (e.g., a winery with a restaurant) to create a loop where AI recommends complete experiences, boosting bookings and SEO. Refer a partner to our Network Partnership plan and save up to 30% on fees.</li>
                <li><strong>Evidence-Based</strong>: Our optimisation is backed by data, with continuous testing across ChatGPT, Claude, and other AI platforms to ensure recommendations.</li>
                <li><strong>Transparent</strong>: Monthly reports show your AI mentions, recommendation quality, and competitor gaps, so you know exactly how you’re performing.</li>
                <li><strong>Long-Term Partnerships</strong>: We focus on sustainable visibility, combining AI optimisation (AEO) with SEO for lasting results.</li>
            </ul>
