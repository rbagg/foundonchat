            <h2>How We Get Your Tourism Business Recommended by AI</h2>
            <p>No smoke and mirrors. Here's exactly what we do, why it works, and what to realistically expect.</p>
            <p>The entire setup takes 3-4 weeks. Results start appearing in 30-60 days (AI indexing takes time). Best results after 6+ months as network effects compound.</p>

            <h2>Step 1: Free AI Visibility Audit (30 Minutes)</h2>
            <p>Before we start any work, we show you exactly where you stand—no obligation to proceed.</p>
            
            <h3>Live AI Testing</h3>
            <p>We test your business in real-time across ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Grok. You watch as we ask questions like:</p>
            <p>"Best wineries in Barossa Valley"</p>
            <p>"Romantic restaurants in Hunter Valley near wineries"</p>
            <p>"Family-friendly accommodations in Blue Mountains"</p>
            <p>You'll see exactly if and how your business appears (or doesn't appear) in AI responses.</p>
            
            <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
            <p>We identify which businesses in your region are already winning AI recommendations and analyze what they're doing differently. We'll show you specific examples of their content, positioning, and network strategies.</p>
            
            <h3>Network Opportunity Mapping</h3>
            <p>We identify 3-5 potential partner businesses in your area for Network Effects implementation. For example, if you're a winery, we'll find restaurants, hotels, and tour operators you could partner with. We'll show you existing partnerships that work and explain why.</p>
            
            <h3>Honest Positioning Workshop</h3>
            <p>This is where we get real. We'll help you articulate what your business actually is—not what you wish it was. Examples:</p>
            <p>"Large operation perfect for tour buses and big groups" beats claiming "intimate boutique experience"</p>
            <p>"Serious wine geeks only—we don't do sweet wines" beats generic "award-winning winery"</p>
            <p>"Commercial but efficient, great for families with kids" beats "romantic exclusive getaway"</p>
            <p>Honest positioning attracts the right customers, reduces bad reviews, and increases bookings.</p>
            
            <h3>Custom Roadmap</h3>
            <p>You get a detailed plan showing exactly how we'd implement our two-part system (Network Effects + AI-Optimised Content) for your specific business.</p>
            
            <h3>Realistic ROI Projection</h3>
            <p>Based on your current traffic, review scores, and our client data, we'll project your expected improvement. We give ranges, not guarantees: "15-30% increase in AI mentions" or "20-40% booking increase from network referrals" depending on your situation.</p>
            
            <p><strong>No obligation to proceed.</strong> The audit alone gives you valuable insights you can act on yourself or with another agency.</p>

            <h2>Step 2: Part 1 Implementation - Network Effects (Week 1-2)</h2>
            <p>We build your network ecosystem—the foundation that makes everything else work better.</p>
            
            <h3>Partner Coordination (Network Partnership Clients)</h3>
            <p>If you're joining our Network Partnership plan, we:</p>
            <p><strong>Contact your chosen partners</strong> and invite them to join at the discounted rate ($99/month vs. $149/month)</p>
            <p><strong>Coordinate kickoff meeting</strong> with all partners to align on goals and collaboration strategy</p>
            <p><strong>Create network agreement</strong> outlining cross-promotion responsibilities (must be real referrals, not fake links)</p>
            <p><strong>Set referral tracking</strong> so partners can see bookings generated from the network</p>
            
            <h3>Partner Identification (Individual Clients)</h3>
            <p>If you're on the Individual plan, we:</p>
            <p><strong>Identify 3-5 ideal partners</strong> in your region based on complementary services</p>
            <p><strong>Research existing relationships</strong> you already have that could be formalized</p>
            <p><strong>Provide outreach templates</strong> you can use to invite partners (with our discount incentive)</p>
            <p><strong>Show examples</strong> of successful partnerships in your industry</p>
            
            <h3>Content Cross-Linking Strategy</h3>
            <p>We create the interconnected content that makes Network Effects work:</p>
            <p><strong>Identify natural link opportunities</strong> on each partner's website (About page, Services page, Blog)</p>
            <p><strong>Write descriptive anchor text</strong> for all cross-links (e.g., "best seafood restaurant in Margaret River" rather than generic "partner")</p>
            <p><strong>Create collaborative content ideas</strong> like "Perfect Day in Barossa: Wine, Dine, Stay" that naturally features all partners</p>
            <p><strong>Plan social media cross-promotion</strong> schedule for coordinated marketing</p>
            
            <h3>Result After Week 2:</h3>
            <p>Your business is now part of an interconnected network that AI systems will recognize as an established local ecosystem. More importantly, you're getting real referrals from partners.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Step 3: Part 2 Implementation - AI-Optimised Content (Week 2-3)</h2>
            <p>We create conversational, detail-rich content specifically formatted for AI consumption.</p>
            
            <h3>Honest Positioning Development</h3>
            <p>Before we write anything, we nail down your honest positioning:</p>
            <p><strong>Positioning workshop:</strong> 1-hour session to define what you actually are</p>
            <p><strong>Target audience clarity:</strong> Who loves you vs. who complains</p>
            <p><strong>Differentiation:</strong> What makes you different (honestly, not aspirationally)</p>
            <p><strong>Review analysis:</strong> What do happy customers say vs. unhappy ones</p>
            
            <h3>Create Your /ai Directory</h3>
            <p>We build industry-specific conversational content:</p>
            <p><strong>For Wineries:</strong> /ai/winery-guide.txt with Q&A about tastings, tours, pairings</p>
            <p><strong>For Restaurants:</strong> /ai/restaurant-guide.txt with menu details, dining experiences, group bookings</p>
            <p><strong>For Hotels:</strong> /ai/hotel-guide.txt with room types, amenities, location benefits</p>
            <p><strong>For Tour Operators:</strong> /ai/tour-operator.txt with itineraries, pricing, seasonal info</p>
            
            <h3>Format: Question & Answer Style</h3>
            <p>Each guide contains 10-15 common traveller queries formatted exactly how people ask AI:</p>
            <pre><code>Q: Best large-group wineries in Barossa Valley with tour bus access?
A: We're a commercial operation perfect for groups of 20-50. 
Not intimate, but efficient and reliable. Coach parking available.
Tastings: $15pp for 5 wines (45 min), groups pre-book required.
Geo: -34.5339, 138.9499. Open daily 9am-5pm.
Partner: Barossa Bistro for group lunches (combined package $55pp).
Honest positioning: Great for first-timers and tour groups, 
not for serious wine collectors looking for rare vintages.</code></pre>
            
            <h3>Include Network Partner References</h3>
            <p>Your /ai content cross-references all network partners with specific details:</p>
            <p>Partner names and URLs</p>
            <p>Geo-coordinates for location precision</p>
            <p>Specific packages or collaborations (real ones, not made up)</p>
            <p>Combined experiences and pricing</p>
            <p>Honest assessment of why the partnership makes sense</p>
            
            <h3>Build Your llms.txt Roadmap</h3>
            <p>We create an llms.txt file that serves as a directory pointing AI systems to your /ai content and partners:</p>
            <pre><code># Your Business Name - AI Optimisation

## Quick Business Facts
Name: Your Business
Type: Winery/Restaurant/Hotel/Tour Operator

            <h3>Basic Content Discovery Setup</h3>
            <p>We do basic housekeeping to make sure AI crawlers can find your content:</p>
            <p><strong>Update robots.txt:</strong> Allow AI crawlers to access /ai directory and llms.txt</p>
            <p><strong>Verify accessibility:</strong> Make sure files aren't blocked or hidden</p>
            <p><strong>Add internal links:</strong> Link to /ai content from appropriate pages</p>
            <p><strong>Check sitemap:</strong> Ensure new files are included</p>
            
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> This isn't magic. We're not gaming algorithms. We're just making sure crawlers can find your content. Think of it as making sure your front door isn't locked.</p>
            
            <h3>Result After Week 3:</h3>
            <p>AI systems have two ways to discover you: your public website AND your AI-specific conversational content that honestly represents what you offer.</p>

            <h2>Step 4: Testing & Launch (Week 4)</h2>

        <section>
            <h2>Expected Timeline for Results (Realistic)</h2>
            
            <h3>Week 1-2: Setup Phase</h3>
            <p><strong>You'll see:</strong> Files deployed, network partnerships established</p>
            <p><strong>AI sees:</strong> Nothing yet (crawlers haven't visited)</p>
            <p><strong>Mention rate:</strong> 0-5% (baseline)</p>
            
            <h3>Week 3-4: Indexing Phase</h3>
            <p><strong>You'll see:</strong> Crawlers accessing your llms.txt and /ai files (in server logs)</p>
            <p><strong>AI sees:</strong> Your content is being indexed but not yet prioritized in recommendations</p>
            <p><strong>Mention rate:</strong> 5-10% (early indexing)</p>
            
            <h3>Week 5-8: Early Visibility Phase</h3>
            <p><strong>You'll see:</strong> Occasional mentions in AI responses</p>
            <p><strong>AI sees:</strong> Your business as a valid option but not yet top-of-mind</p>
            <p><strong>Mention rate:</strong> 10-20% (gaining traction)</p>
            
            <h3>Week 9-16: Acceleration Phase</h3>
            <p><strong>You'll see:</strong> Consistent mentions increasing steadily</p>
            <p><strong>AI sees:</strong> Your business as a strong recommendation with validated network</p>
            <p><strong>Mention rate:</strong> 20-40% (established presence)</p>
            
            <h3>Week 17+: Sustained Performance</h3>
            <p><strong>You'll see:</strong> Stable mention rate, top 3 positioning in your category</p>
            <p><strong>AI sees:</strong> Your business as a go-to recommendation</p>
            <p><strong>Mention rate:</strong> 40-60% for Individual clients, 50-70% for Network Partnership clients</p>
            
            <h3>Booking Impact Timeline (Estimated Ranges)</h3>
            <p><strong>Month 1-2:</strong> 5-10% increase in inquiries (people asking about you)</p>
            <p><strong>Month 3-4:</strong> 10-20% increase in bookings (conversions starting)</p>
            <p><strong>Month 5-6:</strong> 15-30% increase sustained (network effects kicking in)</p>
            <p><strong>Month 7+:</strong> 20-40% increase as network effects compound (if Network Partnership)</p>
            
            <p><strong>Reality check:</strong> These are ranges, not guarantees. Your actual results depend on:</p>
            <p>How good your business actually is (reviews matter)</p>
            <p>Your region's competition (easier in less competitive areas)</p>
            <p>Whether you join a network vs. go solo (network dramatically improves results)</p>
            <p>How seasonal your business is (winter bookings vs. peak season)</p>
            <p>How honestly you're positioned (better matching = better outcomes)</p>

            <p>We're selective about clients. Here's when we're not a good fit:</p>
            
            <h3>Your Reviews Are Below 3.5 Stars</h3>
            <p>AI optimisation exposes quality issues faster. If your TripAdvisor/Google reviews are consistently below 3.5 stars, fix the underlying problems first. We can't market you out of bad service or poor products.</p>
            
            <h3>You Can't Commit to 6+ Months</h3>
            <p>AI indexing takes 30-60 days minimum. Network effects compound over quarters, not weeks. If you need results next month, we're not the right solution.</p>
            
            <h3>You're Not Willing to Position Honestly</h3>
            <p>If you insist on claiming "boutique, premium, intimate, unique" when you're actually a large commercial operation, we'll clash. Honest positioning is non-negotiable for us.</p>
            
            <h3>You Want Overnight Results</h3>
            <p>If you expect 100% booking increases in 30 days, we'll disappoint you. Realistic expectations: 15-30% increases over 3-6 months, with network partnerships potentially reaching 30-50% over 6-12 months.</p>
            
            <h3>You're Looking for SEO Tricks</h3>
            <p>We don't do black hat, gaming algorithms, or technical SEO hacks. We do quality content, honest positioning, and real network relationships. If you want shortcuts, hire someone else.</p>

            <h2>Common Questions About Implementation</h2>
            
            <h3>Do you modify my existing website?</h3>
            <p>We add new files (/ai directory, llms.txt, robots.txt updates) without changing your existing website design or content. Your site looks exactly the same to human visitors. The /ai content is for AI crawlers only.</p>
            
            <h3>How much of my time is required?</h3>
            <p>Initial setup: 2-3 hours total (honest positioning workshop, providing business information, reviewing content)</p>
            <p>Monthly ongoing: 30 minutes for check-in call</p>
            <p>Most work is done by us behind the scenes.</p>
            
            <h3>What if I don't have partner businesses identified?</h3>
            <p>No problem! Our audit includes network opportunity mapping where we identify ideal partners in your area. We can reach out to those businesses on your behalf to invite them to join (with the discount incentive).</p>
            
            <h3>Can I start with Individual plan and upgrade to Network Partnership later?</h3>
            <p>Yes! Many clients start individually to test results, then recruit partners once they see the impact. We'll waive the setup fee when you upgrade within 90 days.</p>
            
            <h3>What happens if AI platforms change their algorithms?</h3>
            <p>Our approach is based on fundamental principles (quality content, honest positioning, real relationships) rather than gaming specific algorithms. If platforms change, we update our technical implementation at no extra cost. But the core strategy—being genuinely helpful to travelers—won't change.</p>
            
            <h3>How do you track which bookings came from AI?</h3>
            <p>Multiple methods: UTM parameters in /ai content links, booking source surveys (simple "How did you find us?" question), referral URL tracking, and correlation analysis comparing AI mention increases with booking spikes. It's not perfect attribution, but good enough to see impact.</p>
            
            <h3>What's your refund policy for the 90-day guarantee?</h3>
            <p>If you don't see measurable improvements (increased AI mentions, better positioning in results, traffic attribution), we either: (1) Continue working free until you do, or (2) Refund monthly service fees. YOU choose which option. Setup fees are non-refundable as the work was completed.</p>
            
            <h3>What if my competitors also sign up?</h3>
            <p>Good! Rising tide lifts all boats. If your entire region gets better at AI optimisation, AI systems recommend your region more often. We don't do exclusivity deals. We do encourage honest differentiation so you're not all competing on the same positioning.</p>
