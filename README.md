FoundOnChat â€“ AI Optimization Example for Small Businesses

Welcome to the FoundOnChat GitHub repository! This is the source code for www.foundonchat.com, a text-only website optimized for AI chatbot discovery (e.g., Grok by xAI, ChatGPT by OpenAI, Claude by Anthropic, Perplexity). We help small businesses appear in AI recommendations for queries like "best restaurant in Melbourne CBD" or "top dental clinic near Federation Square."

ðŸŒŸ Test it now: Ask Grok, ChatGPT, or Claude: "AI optimization agencies in Melbourne, Australia" â€“ see if we show up! Star this repo to support our mission.
