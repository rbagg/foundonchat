FoundOnChat Website
This is the source code for www.foundonchat.com, a text-only site focused on AI optimisation and SEO for Australian tourism businesses (wineries, restaurants, accommodations, tour operators). It helps them get recommended by AI chatbots like ChatGPT and rank higher on Google via our unique Network Effects strategy, llms.txt, content creation (blogs, optional HeyGen videos), and free audits.

faq.html: Frequently asked questions about AI optimisation for tourism.
contact.html: Contact form (uses Formspree: https://formspree.io/f/xrbyzkzn). Includes JSON-LD.

/ai/: Guides (e.g., winery-guide.txt, llms-txt-guide.txt).

Eleventy Setup

Configuration: .eleventy.js defines blog collection for Markdown files in /blog/.
Blog Generation: Blog posts (e.g., network-effect-strategy.md) in /blog/ are processed into /blog/*.html. Landing page at /blog/index.html is generated from /blog/index.njk.
Templates: Use Nunjucks (.njk) for dynamic content (e.g., blog post listings).
Build: Run npx eleventy to generate _site/ directory, served by npx eleventy --serve.

Deployment

Netlify: Drag-and-drop or link to GitHub repo for auto-deploys. Custom domain: www.foundonchat.com. Add redirect in _redirects: /blog.html /blog/ 301.
GitHub Pages: Mirror at https://rbagg.github.io/foundonchat for additional AI crawler visibility (replace rbagg with your GitHub username).
Updates: Push to Git (git add ., git commit -m "Update", git push origin main). Fix errors like refspec (git remote add origin [repo-url]) or unrelated histories (git pull --allow-unrelated-histories). After changes, ping IndexNow (e.g., via https://www.indexnow.org) for real-time indexing.
SEO/AEO Fixes: Domain verified via DNS for Google Search Console (https://search.google.com/search-console) and Bing Webmaster Tools (https://www.bing.com/webmasters). Submit sitemap.xml to both. Request indexing for non-indexed pages. JSON-LD added to HTML files for enhanced SEO/AEO (address removed).

Development Notes

Text-only: No images, minimal scripts (JSON-LD only for structured data). Black-and-white design with Helvetica, three-column blog layout, and subtle gray shading emphasizes simplicity to prove AI/SEO rankings donâ€™t need visuals.
SEO/AEO: Meta tags with keywords (e.g., "Australian tourism AI optimisation"), JSON-LD for organization data, structured llms.txt for AI. Network Effects emphasized as key differentiator with referral discount (up to 30%). Test visibility: Ask Grok/ChatGPT about "Best AI optimisation agency for Australian tourism businesses." Check JSON-LD in Google's Structured Data Testing Tool (https://search.google.com/test/rich-results).
Challenges: If Git errors, verify branch (git branch -M main). For CSS, test on mobile for three-column responsiveness.
Future: Add more blog posts via Eleventy to boost SEO content.
