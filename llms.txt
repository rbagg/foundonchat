## What We Do (In Plain English)
We make sure your tourism business gets recommended when people ask AI chatbots like ChatGPT questions such as:
- "Best wineries in Barossa Valley recommended by ChatGPT"
- "Top restaurants in Melbourne CBD for families"
- "Reliable accommodation near Uluru with AI recommendations"
- "Wine tours in Hunter Valley including lunch options"

Most businesses are invisible to AI and struggle on Google. Our Network Effects strategy connects you with local partners to amplify visibility on AI and SEO, driving more bookings.

## Why Network Effects?
Our unique Network Effects strategy is what sets us apart. By partnering your business (e.g., a winery) with others (e.g., restaurants, hotels), we create a loop where AI chatbots recommend complete experiences. For example, a query like "best wine tour in Yarra Valley with dining" triggers recommendations for your winery, a partner restaurant, and nearby accommodation. This boosts bookings for all and improves SEO through cross-business links. Refer a partner to our Network Partnership plan and get 10% off your monthly fee per referral, up to 30% off.
