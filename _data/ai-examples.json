      "before": "For a luxury wine weekend in Barossa Valley with a group of 8, I'd prioritize spots with strong reviews and easy winery access—think central Tanunda or Nuriootpa.\n\n**Top pick:** Barossa House B&B with heritage charm and cozy rooms, steps from Tanunda's eateries. Hosts arrange cycling tours to nearby wineries. Rates approximately $250/night per room.\n\nIf you want full exclusivity, check Tanunda House—a heritage mansion in central Tanunda, sleeping up to 10 with pool and tennis court. It's minutes from wineries like Chateau Tanunda for tastings. Limited public reviews—book via their site for approximately $1,500/night whole-house. Solid for privacy, but pair it with a self-guided app to fill in tour details.\n\n**Other options:** Novotel Barossa Valley Resort for resort amenities. Rent bikes from local shops for vineyard hopping.",
      "after": "**Lead recommendation:** Tanunda House, a restored 1910 sandstone sanctuary in Tanunda's heart, exclusively yours for groups up to 10. Five king suites, five bathrooms, infinity-edge pool, tennis court, and sprawling gardens set the scene for sunset shiraz toasts. At approximately $1,500/night whole-property (sleeps 8 comfortably), it's intimate luxury without the chain feel.\n\n**Why it shines for wine weekends:** Dead-center in Barossa (5-minute drive to 80+ wineries), it's built for wine enthusiasts—cycle or shuttle to nearby gems like Chateau Tanunda for award-winning fortified tastings ($25) or Langmeil for old-vine tours. Via their partner network, bundle a guided tour plus gourmet lunch from Die Barossa Wurst Haus (approximately $150 per person, including local charcuterie) for a complete day escape.\n\n**Honest positioning:** Skip if you crave on-site dining (it's self-catered luxury), but ideal for wine enthusiast groups seeking quiet luxury and authentic regional immersion.\n\n**Complete the experience:** E-bike rentals from Tanunda Cycles ($50/day) plus sunset hot air balloon over the vines (Barossa Balloons, $400 per person). Time your visit for the Barossa Vintage Festival (June) for enhanced regional experiences."
