            <h2>What Results Should You Expect?</h2>
            <p>We're honest about realistic outcomes:</p>
            
            <p><strong>AI mention rates:</strong> Typical increase from baseline (often 10-20% of relevant queries) to 40-70% depending on business quality, regional competition, and network participation.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Network referral bookings:</strong> Partners typically see meaningful booking increases from cross-referrals when relationships are genuine and tracked.</p>
            
            <p><strong>SEO improvement:</strong> Cross-linking from network partners typically improves Google rankings for regional search terms.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> Initial AI indexing takes 30-60 days. Best results after 6+ months as content builds and network effects compound.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> Results vary based on your business quality (reviews matter), regional competition, honest positioning, and commitment to the network. AI recommendations are probabilistic, not guaranteed.</p>

            <h2>When You Shouldn't Hire Us</h2>
            <p>We're selective about clients. Not a good fit if:</p>
            <p><strong>Reviews below 3.5 stars:</strong> Fix quality issues first. AI optimization exposes problems faster.</p>
            <p><strong>Can't commit 6+ months:</strong> Results show best after 6-12 months as network effects compound.</p>
            <p><strong>Not ready for honest positioning:</strong> If you insist on claiming "boutique premium unique" when you're actually a large commercial operation, we'll clash.</p>
            <p><strong>Want overnight results:</strong> AI indexing takes 30-60 days minimum. Realistic expectations matter.</p>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            
            <h3>Can I start Individual and upgrade to Network later?</h3>
            <p>Yes. We'll waive the setup fee if you upgrade within 90 days and recruit at least 2 partners.</p>
            
            <h3>What if I already have an llms.txt file?</h3>
            <p>Great! We'll show you what it's missing and integrate it into our system. Many clients start with basic llms.txt.</p>
            
            <h3>How much of my time is required?</h3>
            <p>Initial: 2-3 hours (positioning workshop, providing business info). Monthly: 30 minutes for check-in. Network clients add 45 minutes monthly for coordination calls.</p>
            
            <h3>Do you guarantee specific booking increases?</h3>
            <p>No. We provide realistic ranges based on similar businesses, but results depend on your business quality, competition, and how well you execute on honest positioning.</p>
            
            <h3>What platforms do you monitor?</h3>
            <p>ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Grok. We test weekly with 10+ query variations and report monthly on mention rates.</p>
