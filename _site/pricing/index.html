<section>
    <h2>90-Day Guarantee</h2>
    <p>If you don't see measurable improvement in AI mentions within 90 days, you choose:</p>
    <p><strong>Option A:</strong> We continue working free until you see results.</p>
    <p><strong>Option B:</strong> Full refund of all fees paid.</p>
    
    <p><strong>What counts as "measurable improvement"?</strong></p>
    <p>Increase in AI mention rate for relevant queries.</p>
    <p>Better positioning in recommendations.</p>
    <p>Improved recommendation quality matching your actual offerings.</p>
    
    <p>We document baseline during free audit. Track weekly. You see exactly what's improving.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Realistic Expectations</h2>
    
    <h3>Timeline</h3>
    <p>Setup: 3-4 weeks</p>
    <p>Initial indexing: 30-60 days</p>
    <p>Noticeable results: 60-90 days</p>
    <p>Best results: 6-12 months (network effects compound)</p>

    <h3>Typical Results</h3>
    <p>Noticeable improvement in mention rates for relevant queries</p>
    <p>Better customer matching: Fewer mismatched enquiries</p>
    <p>Network referrals: Varies by region and partners</p>
    <p>SEO benefits: Improved rankings from partner cross-links</p>

    <h3>What We Can't Guarantee</h3>
    <p>AI recommendations are probabilistic, not guaranteed.</p>
    <p>Results vary by business quality, regional competition, and implementation.</p>
    <p>We can't fix bad reviews (below 3.5 stars) or fundamental quality issues.</p>
    <p>AI optimisation amplifies what you are.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Why Month-to-Month?</h2>
    <p>Most agencies lock you into 6-12 month contracts. We don't.</p>
    <p>You can cancel anytime. No penalties. Keep all content we created.</p>
    <p>Why? We believe in earning your business monthly.</p>
    <p>If we're not delivering value, you shouldn't pay.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Reality check:</strong> Best results come after 6+ months as network effects compound.</p>
    <p>But we won't force you to commit upfront.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Network Partnership Discount</h2>
    <p>$99/month per business (vs $149 individual). Why the discount?</p>
    
    <p><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Managing 3-5 businesses together is more efficient than individual clients.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Better results:</strong> Networks generate stronger AI signals than isolated businesses.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Shared benefit:</strong> When one partner wins, all partners benefit from cross-referrals.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Three-business network (winery + restaurant + hotel) = $297/month total vs $447 individual.</p>
    <p>Each business gets better results and pays less. Win-win.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>What's Not Included</h2>
    <p>Website redesign or development (we work with your existing site)</p>
    <p>Social media management</p>
    <p>Paid advertising management</p>
    <p>Photography or videography</p>
    <p>Google Business Profile optimisation (though we recommend it)</p>
    
    <p>We focus exclusively on AI optimisation through content and networks.</p>
    <p>This keeps costs down and results focused.</p>
