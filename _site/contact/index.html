    <h2>Schedule Your Free AI Visibility Audit</h2>
    <p>See your potential with our partner networks + AI-friendly content. Free, no strings.</p>

    <h3>Common Questions Before Scheduling</h3>
    
    <details>
        <summary><strong>Q: Is this really free with no strings attached?</strong></summary>
        <p>A: Yes. The audit is genuinely educational. We believe if we show what's possible, the value will be obvious. No high-pressure sales tactics.</p>
    </details>
    
    <details>
        <summary><strong>Q: Do I need to prepare anything for the audit?</strong></summary>
        <p>A: Just have your website URL ready. Be prepared to talk about your business, target customers, and current marketing challenges. We handle the rest.</p>
    </details>
    
    <details>
        <summary><strong>Q: Can I bring a business partner or colleague to the audit?</strong></summary>
        <p>A: Absolutely! If considering Network Partnership, we encourage bringing potential partners so they can see the audit together.</p>
    </details>
    
    <details>
        <summary><strong>Q: What if I already have an llms.txt file?</strong></summary>
        <p>A: Perfect! We'll show what it's missing and how our partner networks + AI-friendly content builds on it. Many clients already have llms.txt when they come to us.</p>
    </details>
    
    <details>
        <summary><strong>Q: I'm not tech-savvy. Will I understand the audit?</strong></summary>
        <p>A: Yes. We explain everything in plain English with live demonstrations. No confusing jargon. If you can browse a website, you'll understand.</p>
    </details>
    
    <details>
        <summary><strong>Q: What if my reviews are below 3.5 stars?</strong></summary>
        <p>A: We'll be honest. AI optimisation won't fix fundamental quality issues—it will expose them faster. We'll help identify what needs fixing first, then come back when you're ready.</p>

    <h3>Why Tourism Businesses Choose FoundOnChat</h3>
    
    <div class="benefit-list">
        <p><strong>Transparency:</strong> We show exactly what we're doing and why it works before you pay anything.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Honest Approach:</strong> We admit what doesn't work (technical SEO tricks) and focus on what does (quality content + real partnerships).</p>
        
        <p><strong>Results Focus:</strong> We track actual AI mentions and bookings, not vanity metrics.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Two-Part Advantage:</strong> We're the only agency implementing Network Effects (partner networks that get bundled recommendations) + AI-Optimised Content together systematically.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Australian Expertise:</strong> We understand Australian tourism regions, seasonality, and what travellers actually ask AI.</p>
        
        <p><strong>90-Day Guarantee:</strong> If you don't see results, we keep working free or refund your fees. Your choice.</p>

<section class="not-right">
    <h3>When You Shouldn't Contact Us</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Your reviews are below 3.5 stars:</strong> Fix quality issues first. We can't market you out of bad service.</li>
        <li><strong>You want overnight results:</strong> AI indexing takes 30-60 days. Network Effects (partner networks that get bundled recommendations) compound over months.</li>
        <li><strong>You're not ready for honest positioning:</strong> If you insist on claiming "boutique premium unique" when you're actually a large commercial operation, we'll clash.</li>
        <li><strong>You can't commit to 6+ months:</strong> Results show best after 6-12 months. Month-to-month billing, but realistic expectations matter.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Better to know upfront.</p>
