    <h2>Schedule Your Free AI Visibility Audit</h2>
    <p>See exactly where you stand before committing. Our 30-minute audit shows what's possible with our two-part system—with no obligation.</p>
    <p><strong>We're selective.</strong> If you're not ready for honest positioning or your reviews need work, we'll tell you in the audit. No point wasting anyone's time.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h3>What You'll Get in Your Free Audit</h3>
    <p><strong>Live AI Testing</strong> - Watch as we test your business across ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Grok in real-time. See exactly if and how AI mentions your business (or doesn't).</p>
    <p><strong>Competitor Analysis</strong> - We identify which tourism businesses in your region win AI recommendations and show what they're doing differently.</p>
    <p><strong>Network Opportunity Map</strong> - We identify 3-5 potential partner businesses in your area perfect for Network Effects implementation.</p>
    <p><strong>Honest Positioning Workshop</strong> - We help articulate what your business actually is (not what you wish it was) so you attract the right customers.</p>
    <p><strong>Custom Roadmap</strong> - Get detailed plan showing exactly how we'd implement both parts (Network Effects + AI-Optimised Content) for your specific business.</p>
    <p><strong>Realistic ROI Projection</strong> - Based on your current traffic, reviews, and our client data, we project expected improvement. Ranges, not guarantees.</p>
    <p><strong>No Obligation</strong> - The audit is educational, not a sales pitch. You walk away with valuable insights whether you sign up or not.</p>

<section>
    <h3>Common Questions Before Scheduling</h3>
    <p><strong>Q: Is this really free with no strings attached?</strong></p>
    <p>A: Yes. The audit is genuinely educational. We believe if we show what's possible, the value will be obvious. No high-pressure sales tactics.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Q: Do I need to prepare anything for the audit?</strong></p>
    <p>A: Just have your website URL ready. Be prepared to talk about your business, target customers, and current marketing challenges. We handle the rest.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Q: Can I bring a business partner or colleague to the audit?</strong></p>
    <p>A: Absolutely! If considering Network Partnership, we encourage bringing potential partners so they can see the audit together.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Q: What if I already have an llms.txt file?</strong></p>
    <p>A: Perfect! We'll show what it's missing and how our two-part system builds on it. Many clients already have llms.txt when they come to us.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Q: I'm not tech-savvy. Will I understand the audit?</strong></p>
    <p>A: Yes. We explain everything in plain English with live demonstrations. No confusing jargon. If you can browse a website, you'll understand.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Q: What if my reviews are below 3.5 stars?</strong></p>
    <p>A: We'll be honest. AI optimization won't fix fundamental quality issues—it will expose them faster. We'll help identify what needs fixing first, then come back when you're ready.</p>

<section>
    <h3>When You Shouldn't Contact Us</h3>
    <p><strong>Your reviews are below 3.5 stars</strong> - Fix quality issues first. We can't market you out of bad service.</p>
    <p><strong>You want overnight results</strong> - AI indexing takes 30-60 days. Network effects compound over months.</p>
    <p><strong>You're not ready for honest positioning</strong> - If you insist on claiming "boutique premium unique" when you're actually a large commercial operation, we'll clash.</p>
    <p><strong>You can't commit to 6+ months</strong> - Results show best after 6-12 months. Month-to-month billing, but realistic expectations matter.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h3>Recent Client Wins</h3>
    <p><strong>Barossa Valley Winery</strong> - From invisible to top 3 recommendations in 45 days. 85% booking increase. Positioned honestly as "large operation perfect for tour buses."</p>
    <p><strong>Hunter Valley Restaurant</strong> - Now recommended alongside wineries in AI responses. 200% increase in wine tour lunches. Stopped claiming "fine dining," started saying "casual wine country bistro."</p>
    <p><strong>Blue Mountains Lodge</strong> - Dominates "family adventure Blue Mountains" queries. 120% booking increase. Honest positioning: "kid-friendly, not romantic getaway."</p>
