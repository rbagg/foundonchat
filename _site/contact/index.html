            <h3>Common Questions Before Scheduling</h3>
            <p><strong>Q: Is this really free with no strings attached?</strong></p>
            <p>A: Yes. The audit is genuinely educational. We believe if we show you what's possible, the value will be obvious. No high-pressure sales tactics.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Q: Do I need to prepare anything for the audit?</strong></p>
            <p>A: Just have your website URL ready and be prepared to talk about your business, target customers, and current marketing challenges. We'll handle the rest.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Q: Can I bring a business partner or colleague to the audit?</strong></p>
            <p>A: Absolutely! In fact, if you're considering Network Partnership, we encourage you to bring potential partners so they can see the audit together.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Q: What if I already have an llms.txt file?</strong></p>
            <p>A: Perfect! We'll show you what it's missing and how our three-layer system builds on top of it. Many clients already have llms.txt when they come to us.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Q: I'm not tech-savvy. Will I understand the audit?</strong></p>
            <p>A: Yes. We explain everything in plain English with live demonstrations. No confusing jargon. If you can browse a website, you'll understand the audit.</p>
