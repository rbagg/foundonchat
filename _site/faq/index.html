            <h3>General Questions</h3>
            <p>Q: What is AI visibility optimisation for tourism?</p>
            <p>A: AI visibility optimisation structures your business info so AI assistants like ChatGPT can recommend your winery, restaurant, or tour to travellers asking queries like "best wineries Barossa Valley".</p>

            <p>Q: How is AI optimisation different from traditional SEO?</p>
            <p>A: SEO focuses on Google rankings; AI optimisation targets recommendations in AI conversations. Our approach complements SEO, enhancing both.</p>

            <p>Q: Which AI platforms do you optimise for?</p>
            <p>A: We optimise for ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Google Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, and Grok, with strategies that work across platforms.</p>

            <p>Q: How long does it take to see results?</p>
            <p>A: Initial improvements in 30-45 days; significant results in 60-90 days, depending on competitiveness and online presence.</p>

            <p>Q: What is an llms.txt file?</p>

            <p>Q: Do you modify our website?</p>
            <p>A: We add AI-optimised pages (e.g., FAQs, guides) and llms.txt without changing existing content, unless requested.</p>

            <p>Q: Is this safe for our SEO?</p>
            <p>A: Yes, it complements SEO by adding structured content that improves search rankings.</p>

            <p>Q: How do you measure success?</p>
