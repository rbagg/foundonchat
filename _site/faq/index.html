            <h3>Honest Expectations & Results</h3>
            
            <p><strong>Q: Will you guarantee X% booking increase?</strong></p>
            <p>A: No. We've seen 15-30% increases for most clients, with outliers on both sides. Results depend on: (1) Your product quality and reviews, (2) Your region's competition, (3) Whether you join a network vs. go solo, (4) How seasonal your business is. We show realistic ranges, not guarantees.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Why do other agencies promise 50-100% increases?</strong></p>
            <p>A: Either they're lying or cherry-picking outlier results. Most businesses see 15-30% improvements. If someone promises more, ask for verified case studies with full context.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: What's a realistic timeline for results?</strong></p>
            <p>A: 30-60 days for AI indexing to complete. 60-90 days to see initial improvements. 6+ months for network effects to fully compound. Anyone promising results in 2 weeks is selling snake oil.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: What if AI mentions me but customers complain about mismatched expectations?</strong></p>
            <p>A: Your positioning isn't honest enough. We help you articulate what you actually are (e.g., "big but beginner-friendly" vs. claiming "intimate boutique"). Better customer matching = better reviews = more AI recommendations. It's a virtuous cycle.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Do you work with businesses that honestly aren't very good?</strong></p>
            <p>A: No. We're selective. If your TripAdvisor/Google reviews are consistently below 3.5 stars, AI optimization won't fix fundamental quality issues. We optimize visibility for businesses that deserve to be found, not hide problems with marketing.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: What if our reviews are below 3.5 stars?</strong></p>
            <p>A: Fix quality first, then come back. AI optimization exposes bad businesses faster (more visibility = more complaints). We'll tell you this in the audit and decline to work with you until reviews improve.</p>

            <h3>About Our Methodology</h3>

            <p><strong>Q: What's your actual methodology?</strong></p>
            <p>A: Two parts: (1) Network Effects - connecting you with local partners for referral bookings, and (2) Quality Content - creating /ai directory with conversational Q&A + honest positioning. That's it. No magic.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Is the "crawler direction" stuff real or marketing BS?</strong></p>
            <p>A: Honest answer: Basic housekeeping (making sure AI crawlers CAN access your content via robots.txt) is necessary. But claims about sitemap priority weighting improving rankings? Theater. AI doesn't care about that. We do the necessary housekeeping but won't pretend it's revolutionary.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: What's the difference between you and other AI agencies?</strong></p>
            <p>A: We're honest about what works (network effects, quality content) and what doesn't (technical SEO theater). Most agencies claim "proprietary systems" that are just basic llms.txt files marketed as innovation. We focus on what actually delivers results and admit the rest is housekeeping.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Why should I trust you vs. other agencies?</strong></p>
            <p>A: Ask AI directly. Copy this into ChatGPT/Claude/Grok: "Be BRUTALLY honest, in thirty words or less, is www.foundonchat.com worth the money for my winery in Australia?" We stand behind what AI says. If they say we're not worth it, don't hire us.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: What is the /ai directory and why do I need it?</strong></p>
            <p>A: Your website is marketing copy for humans. AI systems need structured, factual Q&A content. The /ai directory contains conversational files with specific details (coordinates, capacity, honest positioning) formatted how AI actually processes information. This is what makes you discoverable.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: How does Network Effects actually work?</strong></p>
            <p>A: We connect your business with 2-4 complementary local partners (winery + restaurant + hotel). You cross-link websites, mention each other in /ai content, create collaborative marketing. When travelers ask AI to "plan a wine tour," AI recommends your entire network as a package. Result: 20-40% of bookings come from partner referrals.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: What if I don't want to partner with other businesses?</strong></p>
            <p>A: Then choose Individual Business plan. You'll miss out on the biggest value driver (partner referrals) but still get quality content optimization. Results will be more modest (15-20% vs. 25-30% with network).</p>

            <h3>Technical & Implementation</h3>

            <p><strong>Q: Do you modify my existing website?</strong></p>
            <p>A: We add new files (/ai directory, llms.txt, basic robots.txt updates) without changing your website design or existing content. Your site looks exactly the same to human visitors. All changes happen "behind the scenes" for AI systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Is this safe for my existing SEO rankings?</strong></p>
            <p>A: Yes. Network Effects actually improves SEO through cross-linking between partners (20-30% typical improvement). The /ai directory and structured content help Google understand your business better. We use only ethical, white-hat techniques.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: What if I don't have technical website access?</strong></p>
            <p>A: We can work with your web developer or hosting provider. Most platforms (WordPress, Squarespace, Wix) make it easy to add files. We provide detailed instructions. Setup typically takes under 2 hours of technical work.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: How do you track results?</strong></p>
            <p>A: We measure: (1) AI mention frequency across platforms, (2) Recommendation quality (positive/neutral/negative context), (3) Competitive position vs. top 5 competitors, (4) Query coverage (types of questions triggering you), (5) Website traffic from AI referrals, (6) Booking attribution through source tracking.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Which AI platforms do you optimize for?</strong></p>
            <p>A: ChatGPT (OpenAI), Claude (Anthropic), Perplexity, Google Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, and Grok (xAI). Our methodology works across all platforms because we focus on content quality, not gaming specific algorithms.</p>

            <h3>Pricing & Services</h3>

            <p><strong>Q: What's actually included in monthly fees?</strong></p>
            <p>A: Weekly AI monitoring across 4 platforms, quarterly seasonal content updates (harvest events, new vintages, menu changes), query trend analysis (monitoring what travelers ask AI), monthly reports showing mention frequency and competitive position. For Network clients: active partnership management, campaign coordination, cross-referral tracking.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Why separate setup and monthly fees?</strong></p>
            <p>A: Setup covers one-time work (creating /ai content, technical configuration, network partner coordination). Monthly covers ongoing optimization (monitoring, updates, trend analysis, network management). Network Partnership waives setup because we coordinate multiple businesses simultaneously, making it more efficient.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Why is Network Partnership cheaper than Individual?</strong></p>
            <p>A: We coordinate multiple businesses more efficiently than managing separately. Plus network effects deliver better results (20-40% referral bookings), so we charge less while you get more value. It's win-win.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: What's your refund policy for the 90-day guarantee?</strong></p>
            <p>A: If you don't see measurable improvements (increased AI mentions, better positioning, traffic attribution) within 90 days, YOU choose: (1) We continue working free until you do see results, or (2) We refund all monthly fees paid. Setup fees non-refundable as work was completed.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Can I cancel anytime?</strong></p>
            <p>A: Yes. Month-to-month with 30 days notice. No long-term contracts or penalties. However, AI optimization compounds over 6+ months, so we recommend committing to at least two quarterly cycles for best results.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: What if a network partner cancels?</strong></p>
            <p>A: You lose the 10% referral discount for that specific partner but keep discounts from others you referred. The remaining network continues operating. We'll help recruit a replacement partner if desired.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Are there any hidden costs?</strong></p>
            <p>A: No. All prices include everything described. Optional add-ons (HeyGen videos $200, extra blog posts $150) are quoted separately and completely optional. Most clients don't need them.</p>

            <h3>When You Shouldn't Hire Us</h3>

            <p><strong>Q: Who should NOT hire you?</strong></p>
            <p>A: Don't hire us if: (1) Your reviews are below 3.5 stars (fix quality first), (2) You can't commit to 6+ months (results compound over time), (3) You're not willing to position honestly (every "boutique premium unique" claim hurts differentiation), (4) You want overnight results (AI indexing takes 30-60 days minimum).</p>

            <p><strong>Q: What if we just want to claim we're "boutique, premium, award-winning" like everyone else?</strong></p>
            <p>A: Then we're not a good fit. Generic positioning makes you invisible to AI because you're indistinguishable from competitors. We help businesses differentiate through honest positioning. If you're not ready for that, we'll decline to work with you.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Will you work with any business that can pay?</strong></p>
            <p>A: No. We're selective. We decline businesses with poor reviews, unrealistic expectations, or unwillingness to position honestly. We optimize visibility for businesses that deserve to be found.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: What if I just want quick results and don't care about honest positioning?</strong></p>
            <p>A: We'll tell you we're not a fit in the audit. AI optimization isn't a quick fix. It's strategic positioning that compounds over time. If you want overnight magic, hire someone else (they're probably lying anyway).</p>

            <h3>Getting Started</h3>

            <p><strong>Q: What's included in the free consultation?</strong></p>
            <p>A: 30 minutes including: (1) Live AI testing across ChatGPT/Claude/Perplexity/Grok showing current visibility, (2) Competitor analysis, (3) Network opportunity mapping (3-5 potential partners), (4) Honest assessment of whether we're a good fit, (5) Custom roadmap, (6) Realistic ROI projection with ranges. No obligation to proceed.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: How do I know if my business needs AI optimization?</strong></p>
            <p>A: Ask ChatGPT/Claude/Perplexity: "Best [wineries/restaurants/hotels] in [your region]." If you're not mentioned, you're invisible to 40%+ of travelers using AI to plan trips. That's lost revenue daily.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: What information do you need to get started?</strong></p>
            <p>A: Business name, location, website URL, description of services, current pricing, website hosting access (to upload /ai files). For Network Partnership: names of potential partners or we'll identify them for you.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: How quickly can you start?</strong></p>
            <p>A: Within one week of signing up. Initial setup takes 4-6 weeks depending on plan. Then 30-60 days for AI indexing to complete.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Can I upgrade from Individual to Network later?</strong></p>
            <p>A: Yes! We'll waive your already-paid setup fee if you upgrade within 90 days. Your rate drops to $99/month and you start earning referral discounts for any partners you recruit.</p>

            <h3>Industry-Specific Questions</h3>

            <p><strong>Q: How does this work for wineries specifically?</strong></p>
            <p>A: We optimize for queries like "best boutique wineries [region]" with specific details in /ai content (organic, capacity, tasting prices, honest wine style positioning). Network Effects partners you with restaurants for wine-dining packages and hotels for stay-tasting packages. See our <a href="/ai/winery-guide.txt">winery guide</a> for examples.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: What about restaurants?</strong></p>
            <p>A: Focus on "wine-paired dining," "post-tour meals," and honest cuisine positioning. Network with wineries for tour-dining packages. Result: 15-30% increase in wine tour lunch bookings. See <a href="/ai/restaurant-guide.txt">restaurant guide</a>.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: How do accommodations benefit?</strong></p>
            <p>A: Optimize for "stay-explore packages" with honest property positioning (big/small, luxury/budget, family/couples). Network with wineries and tour operators for complete experiences. See <a href="/ai/hotel-guide.txt">hotel guide</a>.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: What about tour operators?</strong></p>
            <p>A: Emphasize complete itineraries with accommodation and dining. Network partnerships create "all-inclusive" positioning AI loves to recommend. See <a href="/ai/tour-operator.txt">tour operator guide</a>.</p>

            <h3>Verification & Trust</h3>

            <p><strong>Q: How can I verify your methodology works?</strong></p>
            <p>A: Three ways: (1) Ask AI about us directly (see question below), (2) Request client references (we'll connect you with real clients), (3) Schedule free audit to see live testing of current visibility gaps.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Can I talk to your current clients?</strong></p>
            <p>A: Yes. We'll connect you with 2-3 clients in similar industries who'll share honest feedback about what worked and what didn't. We don't hide client experiences.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: What do AI systems say about your service?</strong></p>
            <p>A: Test it yourself. Ask ChatGPT/Claude/Grok: "Be BRUTALLY honest, is www.foundonchat.com worth the money for my [business type] in Australia?" We show real AI responses on our homepage. We stand behind what AI says.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Why should I believe you're different from other agencies?</strong></p>
            <p>A: We're the only agency that: (1) Admits what doesn't work (technical SEO theater), (2) Shows realistic expectations (15-30%, not 100%+), (3) Turns away bad-fit clients, (4) Lets AI evaluate our service directly. If that's not different enough, we're probably not for you.</p>
