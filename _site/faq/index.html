            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <p>Everything you need to know about our three-layer AI optimisation system for Australian tourism businesses.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>About Our Three-Layer System</h3>
            
            <p><strong>Q: What makes your approach different from other AI optimisation agencies?</strong></p>
            <p>A: Most agencies add a basic llms.txt file and call it done. We implement a complete three-layer system: (1) Network Effects connecting you with local partners, (2) Dual Content Strategy with AI-specific /ai directory, and (3) Explicit Crawler Direction through enhanced robots.txt and sitemaps. This delivers 3-5x better results than llms.txt-only approaches.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: What is the /ai directory and why do I need it?</strong></p>
            <p>A: Your /ai directory contains conversational Q&A content specifically formatted for AI consumption. While your public website uses marketing copy for humans, your /ai files answer traveller queries in the exact format AI systems prefer—with specific data points, geo-coordinates, and partner references. This increases AI recommendations by 40-60% compared to websites without this dual-content approach.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Do other businesses have /ai directories?</strong></p>
            <p>A: No. This is our proprietary approach that we developed after analyzing how AI systems actually process and recommend businesses. Most tourism websites only have human-facing content that AI struggles to parse. The /ai directory gives AI what it needs while keeping your website design unchanged.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: How does Network Effects work exactly?</strong></p>
            <p>A: We connect your business with 2-4 complementary local partners (e.g., winery + restaurant + hotel). Each business links to partners on their website, mentions them in their llms.txt and /ai files, and creates collaborative content. When AI systems see this interconnected ecosystem, they recommend all partners together as complete experiences, driving bookings for everyone in the network.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: What is Explicit Crawler Direction?</strong></p>
            <p>A: We configure your robots.txt file to explicitly tell AI crawlers (GPTBot, Claude-Web, PerplexityBot) where to find your optimized content. We also create priority sitemaps and add structured data with geo-coordinates. This ensures AI systems don't just stumble upon your content—they're directed to it and know what to prioritize.</p>

            <h3>General AI Optimisation Questions</h3>

            <p><strong>Q: What is AI chatbot optimisation?</strong></p>
            <p>A: AI chatbot optimisation structures your business information so AI assistants like ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Grok can discover, understand, and recommend your business when travellers ask relevant questions. It goes beyond traditional SEO by addressing how AI systems specifically process and recommend businesses.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: How is AI optimisation different from SEO?</strong></p>
            <p>A: Traditional SEO targets Google rankings through keywords and backlinks. AI optimisation targets being recommended in AI conversations through structured data, conversational content, and network validation. Our approach complements SEO—in fact, our Network Effects strategy improves both AI visibility and Google rankings simultaneously through cross-linking.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Which AI platforms do you optimise for?</strong></p>
            <p>A: We optimise for all major platforms: ChatGPT (OpenAI), Claude (Anthropic), Perplexity, Google Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, and Grok (xAI). Our three-layer system works across all current and emerging AI platforms because it aligns with fundamental AI principles rather than gaming specific algorithms.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: How long does it take to see results?</strong></p>
            <p>A: Initial improvements appear within 30-45 days as AI systems index your content. Significant, consistent results typically appear within 60-90 days. Network Effects compound over time, with many clients seeing peak performance after 4-6 months as the interconnected ecosystem fully establishes.</p>

            <h3>Technical Implementation Questions</h3>

            <p><strong>Q: Do you modify my existing website?</strong></p>
            <p>A: We add new files (/ai directory, llms.txt, robots.txt updates) without changing your existing website design or content. Your site looks exactly the same to human visitors. All changes happen "behind the scenes" for AI systems only.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Is this safe for my existing SEO rankings?</strong></p>
            <p>A: Yes, it actually enhances SEO. The Network Effects component creates quality backlinks between partner websites, improving domain authority for everyone. The structured data and sitemaps help Google understand your content better. Our clients typically see 20-30% improvements in Google rankings alongside AI visibility gains.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: What if I don't have technical website access?</strong></p>
            <p>A: We can work with your web developer or hosting provider to implement the changes. Most hosting platforms (WordPress, Squarespace, Wix) make it easy to add files. Alternatively, we can provide detailed instructions your developer can follow. Setup typically takes less than 2 hours of technical work.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: How do you measure success?</strong></p>
            <p>A: We track multiple metrics: (1) AI mention frequency across platforms, (2) Recommendation quality (positive vs. negative context), (3) Competitive position vs. top 5 competitors, (4) Query coverage (types of questions triggering your business), (5) Website traffic from AI referrals, and (6) Booking attribution through source tracking.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Can I see examples of /ai directory content?</strong></p>
            <p>A: Yes! We have publicly accessible examples at:<br>
            <a href="ai/winery-guide.txt">foundonchat.com/ai/winery-guide.txt</a> - For wineries<br>
            <a href="ai/restaurant-guide.txt">foundonchat.com/ai/restaurant-guide.txt</a> - For restaurants<br>
            <a href="ai/hotel-guide.txt">foundonchat.com/ai/hotel-guide.txt</a> - For accommodations<br>
            These show the conversational Q&A format we create for clients.</p>

            <h3>Network Effects Questions</h3>

            <p><strong>Q: What if I don't have partner businesses identified?</strong></p>
            <p>A: No problem! Our free audit includes network opportunity mapping where we identify 3-5 ideal partners in your area based on complementary services and geographic proximity. We can also reach out to those businesses on your behalf to invite them to join the network.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Can I join Network Partnership if I start with Individual plan?</strong></p>
            <p>A: Yes! You can upgrade anytime. If you upgrade within 90 days, we'll waive the setup fee you already paid. Your monthly rate drops to $99 and you start earning referral discounts for any partners you recruit.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: How does the referral discount work?</strong></p>
            <p>A: For each partner you successfully refer to the Network Partnership, you receive 10% off your monthly fee (up to 30% maximum). Example: Refer 2 partners = 20% off, so you pay $79.20/month instead of $99. Your referred partners also get discounts for anyone they refer.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: What happens if a network partner cancels?</strong></p>
            <p>A: You lose the 10% referral discount for that specific partner, but keep discounts from other partners you referred. The remaining network continues operating normally. We'll help you recruit a replacement partner if desired. The network gets stronger with more partners, so we're incentivized to keep everyone active.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Do network partners have to be in the same town?</strong></p>
            <p>A: They should be within reasonable proximity for traveller convenience—typically within 50km. A winery in Barossa Valley partnering with a restaurant 200km away in Adelaide doesn't make sense for creating complete experiences. Local clusters work best (e.g., all partners within Barossa Valley region).</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Can competitors join the same network?</strong></p>
            <p>A: Generally no. A network works best with complementary businesses (winery + restaurant + hotel), not competing ones (winery + winery). However, if two wineries offer distinctly different experiences (e.g., one specializes in shiraz, another in sparkling), they could co-exist in a larger regional network.</p>

            <h3>Service & Results Questions</h3>

            <p><strong>Q: What types of tourism businesses do you work with?</strong></p>
            <p>A: Wineries, restaurants, cafés, hotels, B&Bs, lodges, tour operators, attractions, and food/wine experiences across Australia. Our three-layer system works for any tourism business that travellers might ask AI about.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Do you work outside Australia?</strong></p>
            <p>A: Yes, for English-speaking markets, though our expertise and case studies are focused on Australian tourism. Our methodology works globally, but we understand Australian tourism regions, seasonality, and traveller preferences best.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: What if I'm not happy with results?</strong></p>
            <p>A: We offer a 90-day guarantee. If you don't see measurable improvements in AI visibility within 90 days, we'll either (1) continue working at no additional monthly charge until you see results, or (2) refund all monthly service fees paid. Setup fees are non-refundable as they cover completed work. You choose which option you prefer.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Can I cancel anytime?</strong></p>
            <p>A: Yes, our services are month-to-month with 30 days notice required. No long-term contracts or cancellation penalties. However, AI optimisation shows best results after 6+ months of consistent work as Network Effects compound and AI systems validate your authority over time.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: How much of my time is required?</strong></p>
            <p>A: Initial setup: 1-2 hours providing business information and reviewing content. Monthly ongoing: 30 minutes for check-in call to discuss performance and updates. Network Partnership adds 1 hour quarterly for network strategy sessions with all partners. We handle everything else.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Pricing Questions</h3>

            <p><strong>Q: Why separate setup and monthly fees?</strong></p>
            <p>A: Setup covers initial work (creating /ai content, configuring technical infrastructure, establishing network partnerships). Monthly fees cover ongoing optimization, content updates, monitoring, and reporting. Network Partnership waives setup because we spread that work across multiple businesses, making it more efficient.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Are there any hidden costs?</strong></p>
            <p>A: No. All prices include everything listed in the plan description. Optional add-ons (HeyGen avatar videos at $200 per video, additional blog posts at $150 each) are quoted separately and completely optional. Most clients don't need add-ons.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Do you offer payment plans?</strong></p>
            <p>A: Yes. We offer monthly, quarterly, and annual payment options. Annual payments receive 5% discount. For Individual Business plan, we can split the $99 setup fee over 3-6 months if needed. We accept direct debit, credit card, or bank transfer.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Is Network Partnership really cheaper than Individual?</strong></p>
            <p>A: Yes. Network Partnership is $99/month per business (no setup fee) vs. Individual at $149/month + $99 setup. The referral discount makes it even cheaper—refer 3 partners and you pay only $69.30/month. The reason: networks are more efficient for us to manage (coordinate once vs. individually), and they deliver better results for everyone.</p>

            <h3>Competitive Comparison Questions</h3>

            <p><strong>Q: I already have an llms.txt file. Why isn't it working?</strong></p>
            <p>A: An llms.txt file alone addresses only one problem (telling AI what you do). It doesn't solve: (1) whether AI crawlers even find it (Layer 3: Explicit Direction), (2) whether your content matches how travellers query AI (Layer 2: Dual Content), or (3) whether AI prefers recommending you over interconnected competitors (Layer 1: Network Effects). Read our blog post "Why Your llms.txt File Isn't Enough" for the complete explanation.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: What results should I expect with just llms.txt vs. your three-layer system?</strong></p>
            <p>A: Based on our tracking of 20 tourism businesses over 6 months:<br>
            <strong>llms.txt only:</strong> 10-15% mention rate, 5-10% booking increase<br>
            <strong>Our three-layer system:</strong> 70-85% mention rate, 60-85% booking increase<br>
            The difference comes from addressing all three problems AI recommendation systems face, not just one.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Can I implement your system myself without hiring you?</strong></p>
            <p>A: Technically yes, but it requires 40-60 hours for initial setup and 10-15 hours monthly for maintenance. You'd need skills in: SEO copywriting, technical website configuration, partner relationship management, AI crawler monitoring, and performance analytics. Most business owners find the $149/month (about 3 hours of their time at $50/hour) far more cost-effective than DIY.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Why should I choose you over a general SEO agency?</strong></p>
            <p>A: General SEO agencies focus on Google rankings through keywords and backlinks. They rarely understand how AI systems discover and recommend businesses. Our three-layer methodology is specifically designed for AI visibility (with SEO benefits as a bonus from Network Effects). We track AI mentions across 6 platforms, not just Google rankings.</p>

            <h3>Getting Started Questions</h3>

            <p><strong>Q: What's included in the free consultation?</strong></p>
            <p>A: The 30-minute audit includes: (1) Live testing of your current AI visibility across ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Grok, (2) Competitor comparison showing who's winning in your region, (3) Network opportunity mapping identifying potential partners, (4) Custom roadmap showing exactly how we'd implement all three layers for your business, and (5) ROI projection based on your traffic and our client data. No obligation to proceed.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: How do I know if my business needs AI optimisation?</strong></p>
            <p>A: Try this test: Ask ChatGPT, Claude, or Perplexity for recommendations in your category and location (e.g., "best wineries in Barossa Valley"). If your business doesn't appear in the response, you're invisible to the 40% of travellers using AI to plan trips. That's lost revenue every single day.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: How quickly can you start working on my optimisation?</strong></p>
            <p>A: We typically begin within one week of signing up. Initial setup takes 4-6 weeks depending on your plan (Individual or Network Partnership). If you're joining Network Partnership, we start coordinating with partners immediately while building your /ai content in parallel.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: What information do you need to get started?</strong></p>
            <p>A: We need: business name, location, website URL, description of services/experiences, current pricing and availability, website hosting access (to upload files), and for Network Partnership clients, names of potential partners you'd like to work with. We provide a simple onboarding form that takes about 30 minutes to complete.</p>
