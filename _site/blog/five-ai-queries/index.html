            <h2>Five AI Queries Your Tourism Business Should Own</h2>
            <p>Published: 11 October 2025</p>
            <div class="blog-content">
                <h2>Five AI Queries Your Tourism Business Should Own</h2>
<p>Not all AI queries are created equal. Some drive bookings. Others waste your time.</p>
<p>Here's how to identify the five queries that matter most for your business. Plus how to own them.</p>
<h3>Why Query Selection Matters</h3>
<p>You can't optimise for everything. Need to focus.</p>
<p>Wrong approach: &quot;I want to rank for 'best winery Australia.'&quot;
Too broad. Too competitive. Wrong customer intent.</p>
<p>Right approach: &quot;I want to own 'best large-group wineries Barossa with tour bus access.'&quot;
Specific. Clear intent. Matches what you actually offer.</p>
<h3>The Five Query Types Every Tourism Business Needs</h3>
<p><strong>Query Type 1: Core Offering Query</strong>
What you're fundamentally known for.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Winery: &quot;Best shiraz tastings Barossa Valley&quot;</li>
<li>Restaurant: &quot;Where to eat after wine tasting McLaren Vale&quot;</li>
<li>Hotel: &quot;Family accommodation Hunter Valley with pool&quot;</li>
<li>Tour operator: &quot;Blue Mountains hiking tours for beginners&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>This is your bread and butter. You must appear for this query.</p>
<p><strong>Query Type 2: Honest Positioning Query</strong>
What you actually are (not what you wish you were).</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Large commercial winery: &quot;Best wineries Barossa for tour buses&quot;</li>
<li>Casual bistro: &quot;Relaxed lunch spots Hunter Valley wine region&quot;</li>
<li>Budget accommodation: &quot;Affordable hotels Barossa under $150&quot;</li>
<li>Adventure tours: &quot;Challenging hikes Blue Mountains experienced hikers&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Most businesses ignore this. They chase aspirational positioning. Big mistake.</p>
<p>Your actual positioning query has less competition. Better customer match. Higher conversion.</p>
<p><strong>Query Type 3: Complete Experience Query</strong>
Traveller needs multiple businesses for full trip.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Barossa wine weekend with accommodation and dining&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Hunter Valley day trip - tasting, lunch, and transport&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Blue Mountains family adventure - hiking, accommodation, meals&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;McLaren Vale winery tour with lunch reservations&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>These queries require networks. You can't win alone. Need partner references.</p>
<p><strong>Query Type 4: Problem-Solution Query</strong>
Traveller has specific constraint or need.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Best wineries Barossa Valley for large groups&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Restaurants McLaren Vale that take bookings same day&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Kid-friendly accommodation Blue Mountains&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Wheelchair accessible wine tours Yarra Valley&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>These are gold. High intent. Specific need. Less competition.</p>
<p><strong>Query Type 5: Seasonal/Event Query</strong>
Time-sensitive opportunities.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Barossa Vintage Festival accommodation April&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Hunter Valley spring release tastings September&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Blue Mountains autumn foliage best hikes&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;McLaren Vale Sea and Vines Festival restaurants&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Update content monthly. Capture seasonal surge. High-conversion window.</p>
<h3>How to Identify Your Five Queries</h3>
<p><strong>Step 1: Ask Your Customers</strong></p>
<p>What did they search before finding you? What questions did they ask when enquiring?</p>
<p>Don't guess. Ask 10 recent bookings. You'll see patterns.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Test AI Systems Directly</strong></p>
<p>Go to ChatGPT. Ask variations:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Best [your business type] in [your region]&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Where to [activity] in [region] for [audience]&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;[Region] [season] [activity] recommendations&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>See what travellers actually ask. See who gets recommended.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Analyse Your Competitors</strong></p>
<p>Which businesses appear in AI responses? What queries trigger them?</p>
<p>Test 20 query variations. Track who appears. Identify gaps.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Match to Your Honest Positioning</strong></p>
<p>Don't chase queries you can't win. Or shouldn't win.</p>
<p>Small intimate winery? Don't optimise for &quot;large group&quot; queries. You'll attract wrong customers.</p>
<p>Focus on queries matching what you actually are.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Prioritise by Intent</strong></p>
<p>High intent = ready to book. Low intent = just browsing.</p>
<p>&quot;Book family accommodation Blue Mountains this weekend&quot; = high intent
&quot;Things to do Blue Mountains&quot; = low intent</p>
<p>Prioritise high-intent queries.</p>
<h3>Real Example: Barossa Valley Winery</h3>
<p><strong>Their situation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Large commercial operation</li>
<li>Handles groups of 20-50 easily</li>
<li>Tour bus access</li>
<li>Not intimate or boutique</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Their five queries:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>&quot;Best large-group wineries Barossa Valley&quot; (core + honest positioning)</li>
<li>&quot;Barossa wineries with tour bus parking&quot; (problem-solution)</li>
<li>&quot;Barossa wine tour with lunch for groups&quot; (complete experience)</li>
<li>&quot;Corporate wine tasting events Barossa&quot; (audience-specific)</li>
<li>&quot;Barossa Vintage Festival large group bookings&quot; (seasonal)</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice what they're NOT targeting:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Intimate boutique wineries Barossa&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Small family wineries Barossa&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Exclusive private tastings Barossa&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Why? Because that's not what they are. Those queries would attract wrong customers.</p>
<h3>How to Own Your Five Queries</h3>
<p><strong>Step 1: Create Dedicated Q&amp;A Content</strong></p>
<p>For each query, create conversational Q&amp;A in your /ai directory.</p>
<p>Example: /ai/large-group-tours.txt</p>
<pre><code>Q: Best wineries Barossa for large groups with tour bus access?
A: [Your Winery Name] - purpose-built for groups of 20-50. 
Coach parking on-site. Group tasting packages from $25pp.
Commercial operation, not intimate boutique.
Perfect for: Corporate groups, tour operators, wine clubs
Book ahead: [contact details]
</code></pre>
<p>Be specific. Include pricing. State honest positioning. Give booking info.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Reference Network Partners</strong></p>
<p>For complete experience queries, reference complementary businesses.</p>
<p>&quot;Best lunch after tour? We recommend [Restaurant Name] 2km away. They handle groups up to 40. Book ahead: [details]&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Overnight stays? [Hotel Name] offers group rates and shuttle service. Contact: [details]&quot;</p>
<p>This helps you appear in bundled recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Update Monthly</strong></p>
<p>Queries trend. Seasonal variations. New competitors. Pricing changes.</p>
<p>Add 3-5 new Q&amp;As monthly targeting current trending queries.</p>
<p>Monitor AI systems weekly. See which queries you're winning. Which you're losing.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Use Specific Details</strong></p>
<p>Vague content loses. Specific content wins.</p>
<p>Bad: &quot;We offer great group experiences&quot;
Good: &quot;Groups of 20-50 people, $25pp tasting package, 90-minute duration, coach parking available&quot;</p>
<p>AI systems prefer specific details. Easier to match to queries.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Track Performance</strong></p>
<p>Test your five queries weekly across ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Grok.</p>
<p>Do you appear? What position? What description?</p>
<p>Document changes. Adjust content based on results.</p>
<h3>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h3>
<p><strong>Mistake 1: Chasing Volume Over Intent</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Best things to do in Barossa&quot; gets huge search volume. But terrible intent.</p>
<p>&quot;Best large-group wineries Barossa with tour bus parking&quot; gets tiny volume. But perfect intent.</p>
<p>Focus on intent, not volume.</p>
<p><strong>Mistake 2: Ignoring Honest Positioning</strong></p>
<p>Trying to appear for &quot;boutique intimate&quot; queries when you're large and commercial.</p>
<p>You might occasionally appear. But you'll attract wrong customers. Poor reviews follow.</p>
<p>Own what you actually are.</p>
<p><strong>Mistake 3: Targeting Only One Query Type</strong></p>
<p>Need all five types. Core offering + honest positioning + complete experience + problem-solution + seasonal.</p>
<p>Diversify. Different queries drive bookings at different times.</p>
<p><strong>Mistake 4: Set and Forget</strong></p>
<p>Queries trend. Competition changes. Seasons shift.</p>
<p>Update monthly. Monitor weekly. Adjust constantly.</p>
<p><strong>Mistake 5: Trying to Win Alone</strong></p>
<p>Complete experience queries require networks. You can't win these solo.</p>
<p>Partner with complementary businesses. Reference each other. Win together.</p>
<h3>What About Long-Tail Queries?</h3>
<p>&quot;Should I optimise for 'best organic shiraz tastings under $50 for couples in their 30s Barossa Valley spring weekends'?&quot;</p>
<p>No. Too specific. No volume.</p>
<p>Sweet spot: Specific enough for clear intent. Broad enough for reasonable volume.</p>
<p>Test: If you ask 10 people whether they'd search this, 3-4 should say yes.</p>
