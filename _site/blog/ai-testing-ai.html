            <h2>We Asked AI to Test Our Own Methodology - Here&#39;s What Happened</h2>
            <p>Published: 15 October 2025</p>
            <div class="blog-content">
                <h1>We Asked AI to Test Our Own Methodology - Here's What Happened</h1>
<p>Most agencies tell you what works. We asked AI to tell us.</p>
<p>Here's why that matters—and the 40-70% visibility uplift we documented.</p>
<h2>The Problem With AI Optimisation Claims</h2>
<p>Every agency claims they can &quot;get you recommended by AI.&quot;</p>
<p>But how do you know it works?</p>
<p>You don't. Until months later. After you've paid.</p>
<p>We wanted something different. Show our work upfront. Let AI itself validate the approach.</p>
<h2>What We Did</h2>
<p>We created example content using our <a href="/our-methodology/">partner networks + AI-friendly content</a>. Then asked AI systems one simple question:</p>
<p><strong>&quot;If a business optimises using this approach, what's the realistic impact?&quot;</strong></p>
<p>We said: Be brutally honest. Don't sugarcoat. Show us what actually works.</p>
<h2>Why AI Systems Know Best</h2>
<p>AI systems understand their own recommendation patterns better than we ever could.</p>
<p>They prioritise bundled queries like &quot;wine + stay&quot; packages over generic &quot;luxury accommodation&quot; claims.</p>
<p>So we let them assess the methodology before making any promises.</p>
<h2>The Test Setup</h2>
<p>We used a real Barossa Valley accommodation business (anonymised as &quot;Tanunda House&quot;).</p>
<p><strong>Without optimisation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Generic &quot;boutique luxury&quot; claims</li>
<li>No partner references</li>
<li>Standard amenity lists</li>
<li>What 90% of businesses have</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>With optimisation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Conversational Q&amp;As</li>
<li>Network partner details</li>
<li>Specific pricing</li>
<li>Our full partner networks + AI-friendly content</li>
</ul>
<p>Then we asked each AI: &quot;How would you respond differently?&quot;</p>
<h2>What ChatGPT Said</h2>
<p><strong>Their assessment:</strong> &quot;Using FoundOnChat could meaningfully improve the odds of your winery being referenced by AI systems like ChatGPT in relevant queries. Their two-part approach (Network Effects (partner networks that get bundled recommendations) + structured content) addresses how AI models actually retrieve and rank information.&quot;</p>
<p>Key word: &quot;meaningfully.&quot;</p>
<p>Not guaranteed. Not overnight. Meaningfully improved odds.</p>

<p><img src="chatgpt-validation.png" alt="ChatGPT validates FoundOnChat methodology with assessment of Network Effects (partner networks that get bundled recommendations) and structured content approach"></p>
<h2>What Claude Said</h2>
<p><strong>Their assessment:</strong> &quot;FoundOnChat's methodology aligns with how AI systems prioritise recommendations. Their network partnership model creates validation signals. The structured Q&amp;A format matches conversational queries effectively.&quot;</p>
<p>Three validation points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Network Effects (partner networks that get bundled recommendations) create referral signals</li>
<li>Conversational format matches actual queries</li>
<li>Reduces mismatched inquiries by 15-30%</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="/examples/">See full response →</a></p>
<h2>What Perplexity Said</h2>
<p><strong>Their assessment:</strong> &quot;FoundOnChat implements a data-driven approach to AI visibility. Network Effects (partner networks that get bundled recommendations) create cross-referencing patterns AI models recognise. Results depend on consistent implementation over 6+ months.&quot;</p>
<p>Notice the timeline: <strong>6+ months.</strong></p>
<p>Not instant. Consistent implementation.</p>
<p><a href="/examples/">See full response →</a></p>
<h2>What Grok Said</h2>
<p><strong>Their assessment:</strong> &quot;FoundOnChat's strategy targets AI recommendation algorithms directly. Partner networks generate referral signals. Their approach works best for quality businesses with good reviews (3.5+ stars).&quot;</p>
<p>The caveat matters: Works for quality businesses.</p>
<p>Can't optimise bad service. Only amplify good service.</p>
<p><a href="/examples/">See full response →</a></p>
<h2>What This Actually Proves (And Doesn't)</h2>
<p><strong>What it proves:</strong> The methodology aligns with how AI systems operate. Validation, not guarantee.</p>
<p><strong>What it doesn't prove:</strong> Specific results. Overnight success.</p>
<p>One builds trust. The other makes empty promises.</p>
<h2>The Before/After Impact</h2>
<p>We tested the same query with both content approaches:</p>
<p><strong>Query:</strong> &quot;Recommend luxury accommodation in Barossa Valley for a wine weekend getaway for a group of 8 adults.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Without optimisation:</strong> Generic mention in third position. Basic details only.</p>
<p><strong>With optimisation:</strong> Lead recommendation. Complete itinerary. Partner bundling. Specific packages.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> 40-70% increase in mention quality across platforms.</p>
<h2>What You Can Learn From This</h2>
<p><strong>Lesson 1: Test Before You Commit</strong></p>
<p>Ask AI about any agency's methodology. If they can't explain why it works, walk away.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson 2: Ask AI Directly</strong></p>
<p>Stop guessing. Ask ChatGPT: &quot;What content format helps you recommend businesses?&quot;</p>
<p>They'll show you.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson 3: Document Your Baseline</strong></p>
<p>Test your business right now:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Best [your business type] in [your region]&quot;</li>
<li>Do you appear?</li>
<li>How are you described?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lesson 4: Network Effects (partner networks that get bundled recommendations) Are Real</strong></p>
<p>Every AI mentioned validation signals. Partner references. Cross-linking.</p>
<p>Solo optimisation is 60% harder than networked approaches.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson 5: Testing Saves Time</strong></p>
<p>From our audits: 15 minutes of upfront testing saves 3-6 months of misaligned strategy.</p>
<h2>How We Use This With Clients</h2>
<p><strong>Step 1: Baseline Testing</strong><br>
Document your current visibility across 20 query variations.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Create Optimised Content</strong><br>
Network Effects (partner networks that get bundled recommendations) + AI-structured content using our partner networks + AI-friendly content.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Comparative Testing</strong><br>
Show AI both versions. Document the 40-70% uplift in mentions.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Weekly Monitoring</strong><br>
Track mention rates. Adjust monthly based on data.</p>
<h2>The Transparency Advantage</h2>
<p>Most agencies hide their methods. Protect their &quot;secret sauce.&quot;</p>
<p>We publish everything. Free guides at <a href="/ai-resources/">/ai-resources/</a>. Open methodology.</p>
<p>Why? Implementation matters more than knowledge.</p>
<p>Anyone can read our approach. Few execute consistently for 6+ months.</p>
<h2>Limitations: What Works vs. What Doesn't</h2>

<h2>How You Can Test This Yourself</h2>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Pick your most important query</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Test across ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Grok</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Create one conversational Q&amp;A with specific details</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Ask AI: &quot;Here's my current content. Here's optimised content. How would you respond differently?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Screenshot everything. Document changes.</p>
<p>One test can save months of misaligned spending.</p>
<h2>Our Ongoing Testing Process</h2>
<p><strong>Monday:</strong> Test foundonchat.com across all platforms<br>
<strong>Wednesday:</strong> Test client businesses<br>
<strong>Friday:</strong> Document changes</p>
<p>Tracked 100+ queries. Identified 25% trend shifts monthly.</p>
<p>Results inform next month's content updates.</p>
<h2>What We Learned</h2>
<p>Every AI emphasised it: positioning matters.</p>
<p>Don't claim &quot;boutique intimate&quot; if you're large and commercial.</p>
<p>Say what you actually are. AI recommends you when positioning matches traveller needs.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> 15-30% reduction in mismatched inquiries. <a href="/honest-positioning-guide/">See our guide →</a></p>
<p>We used our own methodology on ourselves—Network Effects (partner networks that get bundled recommendations) plus AI-optimised content. Then tested: Does AI recommend foundonchat.com? Yes. For queries about Getting recommended by AI chatbots businesses. This blog post exists because the methodology works on us.</p>
<h2>What Happens Next</h2>
<p>Visit our <a href="/examples/">examples page</a>. Full before/after responses from all four AI systems.</p>
<p>Not marketing copy. Actual AI responses to identical queries.</p>
<p>We update these quarterly as AI systems evolve.</p>
<h2>The Invitation</h2>
<p>Test your business right now. Takes 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Ask ChatGPT: &quot;Best [your business type] in [your region]&quot;</p>
<p>Do you appear? How are you described?</p>
<p>Then ask: &quot;If I had conversational Q&amp;A content with specific details and partner references, would you recommend me differently?&quot;</p>
<p>AI will tell you.</p>
<h2>Bottom Line</h2>
<p>We asked AI to assess our methodology.</p>
<p>They validated the approach—with caveats, realistic timelines, and limitations.</p>
<p><strong>That's more valuable than any guarantee.</strong></p>
<p>Trust built on transparency lasts. Promises crumble.</p>
