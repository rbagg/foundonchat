            <h2>How to Get Your Winery Recommended by ChatGPT - Complete 2025 Guide</h2>
            <p>Published: 20 October 2025</p>
            <div class="blog-content">
                <p>When travelers ask ChatGPT &quot;best wineries in Barossa Valley&quot; or Claude &quot;where to visit in Margaret River,&quot; does your winery appear?</p>
<p>Most Australian wineries don't. Here's how to fix that.</p>
<h2>Why This Matters Now</h2>
<p><strong>The shift is happening:</strong> 40% of travelers now ask AI chatbots for recommendations before Google searches.</p>
<p>When someone asks ChatGPT &quot;plan a wine weekend in Hunter Valley,&quot; AI generates a complete itinerary. Wineries, restaurants, accommodationâ€”all decided in 30 seconds.</p>
<p>If you're not in that response, you don't exist to that traveler.</p>
<h2>Test Yourself Right Now (Takes 2 Minutes)</h2>
<p>Before reading further, test your current visibility:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open ChatGPT (free version works)</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Ask: &quot;Best [your wine style] wineries in [your region] for [your ideal customer]&quot;</p>
<p>Example: &quot;Best shiraz wineries in Barossa Valley for groups of 20-30 people&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Do you appear?</p>
<ul>
<li>Not at all? You need this guide.</li>
<li>Mentioned vaguely? You need better content.</li>
<li>Lead recommendation with details? You're doing something right.</li>
</ul>
<p>Screenshot your result. Compare after implementing this guide.</p>
<h2>What ChatGPT Actually Looks For</h2>
<p>After testing 100+ wineries across Australia, we've identified what gets businesses recommended:</p>
<h3>1. Conversational Q&amp;A Format</h3>
<p><strong>What doesn't work:</strong> &quot;Award-winning boutique winery offering premium experiences&quot;</p>
<p><strong>What works:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Q: Best wineries in Barossa for large groups with tour bus access?
A: [Your Winery] - purpose-built for groups of 20-50. Coach parking on-site. 
Group tastings $25pp. Commercial operation, not intimate boutique. 
Book ahead: [contact details]
</code></pre>
<p>ChatGPT prefers content matching how people actually ask questions.</p>
<h3>2. Specific Details Over Marketing Fluff</h3>
<p><strong>Vague (ignored):</strong> &quot;Exceptional wines in stunning location&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Specific (recommended):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Tasting fees: $20pp standard, $35pp premium flight</li>
<li>Group capacity: 8-12 people maximum</li>
<li>Opening hours: 10am-5pm daily, closed Tuesdays</li>
<li>Location: 15-minute drive from Tanunda, GPS coordinates: -34.5339, 138.9499</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Honest Positioning</h3>
<p><strong>Don't claim:</strong> &quot;Intimate boutique experience&quot; (if you're large and commercial)</p>
<p><strong>Do say:</strong> &quot;Large family-run operation handling groups up to 50. Perfect for tour buses and corporate events. Not ideal for couples seeking private tastings.&quot;</p>
<p>Honesty reduces mismatched inquiries by 15-30%. Better customer fit means better reviews.</p>
<h3>4. Partner Networks</h3>
<p><strong>Weak:</strong> Stand-alone winery listing</p>
<p><strong>Strong:</strong> &quot;After tasting, we recommend lunch at [Restaurant Name] 2km away - wine-paired menu $85pp. They offer 10% discount with our voucher. Overnight? [Hotel Name] provides group rates and shuttle service.&quot;</p>
<p>ChatGPT prefers recommending complete experiences. Partner references signal you're part of a validated ecosystem.</p>
<h3>5. Fresh, Updated Content</h3>
<p><strong>Last updated 2022:</strong> Ignored by AI crawlers</p>
<p><strong>Updated monthly:</strong> Prioritized in recommendations</p>
<p>Add 3-5 new Q&amp;As monthly covering:</p>
<ul>
<li>Seasonal offerings (vintage releases, harvest events)</li>
<li>Trending queries (&quot;best wineries for [new trend]&quot;)</li>
<li>Recent changes (new tasting room, updated packages)</li>
</ul>
<h2>The DIY Method (2-3 Hours Setup)</h2>
<p>Want to try this yourself before hiring anyone? Here's the complete process:</p>
<h3>Hour 1: Create Your llms.txt File</h3>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Create file at <code>yourwinery.com/llms.txt</code></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Add this content:</p>
<pre><code># [Your Winery Name]
# [Your region] winery specializing in [your focus]

## Main Content
https://yourwinery.com/about
https://yourwinery.com/wines
https://yourwinery.com/visit

## AI-Optimized Content
https://yourwinery.com/ai/tastings.txt
https://yourwinery.com/ai/groups.txt
https://yourwinery.com/ai/partners.txt

## Contact
Email: [your email]
Phone: [your phone]
Address: [full address]
</code></pre>
<p>This tells ChatGPT where to find your key information.</p>
<h3>Hour 2: Create Your /ai Directory</h3>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Create folder at <code>yourwinery.com/ai/</code></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Create <code>tastings.txt</code> with conversational Q&amp;As:</p>
<pre><code># [Your Winery Name] - Tasting Information

Q: What are tasting options at [Your Winery]?
A: Three tasting experiences available:
- Standard Flight: $20pp, 5 wines, 30 minutes
- Premium Flight: $35pp, 6 reserve wines, 45 minutes
- Private Tasting: $75pp, 8 wines with winemaker, 90 minutes (bookings required, groups up to 8)

Open daily 10am-5pm except Tuesdays. Walk-ins welcome for standard/premium. Private tastings require 48-hour advance booking.

Q: Can [Your Winery] handle large groups?
A: Yes, groups up to 50 people. Dedicated function space. Tour bus parking available. Group packages from $25pp including tasting and cellar tour. Advance booking essential. Contact [email/phone].

Q: What wines is [Your Winery] known for?
A: Shiraz specialists. Flagship [wine name] ($65/bottle) consistently rates 95+ points. Also produce [list other varietals]. All estate-grown, minimal intervention winemaking. 

Q: Where is [Your Winery] located?
A: [Address], [Region]. 15-minute drive from [nearby town]. GPS coordinates: [coordinates]. Free parking for cars and coaches.

Honest positioning: Large commercial operation, not intimate boutique. Perfect for groups and tour buses. Skip if seeking exclusive private experience.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Create <code>partners.txt</code>:</p>
<pre><code># [Your Winery] - Partner Recommendations

Q: Where to eat after tasting at [Your Winery]?
A: We recommend [Restaurant Name], 2km north. Wine-paired menu $85pp. They feature our wines. 10% discount with our voucher (ask at tasting room). Bookings: [restaurant contact].

Q: Accommodation near [Your Winery]?
A: Partner with [Hotel Name], 5km away. Wine country suites from $180/night. Mention [Your Winery] for complimentary bottle on arrival. They offer winery shuttle service. Bookings: [hotel contact].

Q: Complete [Region] wine weekend package?
A: Our &quot;Weekend in [Region]&quot; package combines:
- Friday: Arrive [Hotel Name], welcome wine
- Saturday: Morning tasting at [Your Winery] ($35pp) + lunch at [Restaurant Name] ($85pp)
- Sunday: Optional cellar tour before checkout
Total package: $320pp (twin share). Book through [Your Winery]: [contact details].

We track actual referrals monthly - these are real partnerships, not just links.
</code></pre>
<h3>Hour 3: Update Your Website</h3>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Add link to AI content in footer:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;a href=&quot;/ai/tastings.txt&quot;&gt;AI-Friendly Tasting Info&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Create simple landing page at <code>/ai-content.html</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;h2&gt;AI-Optimized Content for ChatGPT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machine-readable information about [Your Winery] for AI search engines and chatbots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/ai/tastings.txt&quot;&gt;Tasting Options &amp; Pricing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/ai/groups.txt&quot;&gt;Group Bookings &amp; Facilities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/ai/partners.txt&quot;&gt;Partner Recommendations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Done.</strong> You've created ChatGPT-friendly content.</p>
<h2>Testing Your Changes (Week 1)</h2>
<p><strong>Day 1:</strong> Deploy changes to your website</p>
<p><strong>Day 3:</strong> Ask ChatGPT your key queries again. Screenshot results.</p>
<p><strong>Day 7:</strong> Test across all platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li>ChatGPT: &quot;Best wineries in [your region]&quot;</li>
<li>Claude: &quot;Plan wine tour in [your region]&quot;</li>
<li>Perplexity: &quot;[Your region] winery recommendations&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Most wineries see initial changes within 7-14 days as AI systems re-crawl content.</p>
<h2>Realistic Timeline: What to Expect</h2>
<p><strong>Week 1-2:</strong> AI systems crawl your new content</p>
<p><strong>Week 3-4:</strong> You start appearing in some ChatGPT responses (often not lead position yet)</p>
<p><strong>Month 2:</strong> Mentions become more frequent, descriptions more detailed</p>
<p><strong>Month 3:</strong> Lead recommendations for your specific queries (e.g., &quot;large group wineries Barossa&quot;)</p>
<p><strong>Month 6+:</strong> Strong positioning across multiple query types, partner bundling kicks in</p>
<p><strong>Don't expect:</strong> Overnight results. Guaranteed top position. Universal mentions for all wine queries.</p>
<p><strong>Do expect:</strong> Gradual improvement. Better descriptions when mentioned. More qualified inquiries.</p>
<h2>When DIY Isn't Enough</h2>
<p>The DIY method works if you have:</p>
<ul>
<li>âœ… Time to create 10+ Q&amp;As covering all query types</li>
<li>âœ… Complementary businesses willing to partner (restaurant, hotel, tours)</li>
<li>âœ… Commitment to monthly updates (3-5 new Q&amp;As)</li>
<li>âœ… Ability to track results across 4 AI platforms weekly</li>
</ul>
<p>Most winery owners don't have this time. That's where professional help makes sense.</p>
<h2>The Professional Method: What We Do Differently</h2>
<p><strong>DIY approach:</strong> Create content once, hope it works</p>
<p><strong>Our approach:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Research your 5 most important queries specific to your business</li>
<li>Create 15-20 Q&amp;As covering all query variations</li>
<li>Recruit 2-4 partner businesses in your region</li>
<li>Set up real referral programs (vouchers, packages, tracking)</li>
<li>Update content monthly based on trending queries</li>
<li>Track performance across all AI platforms weekly</li>
<li>Adjust strategy based on actual results</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Timeline:</strong> 3-4 weeks setup, then monthly optimization</p>
<p><strong>Investment:</strong> $149/month individual, $99/month for network partnerships (3+ businesses)</p>
<p><strong>Guarantee:</strong> 90 days money-back if no improvement in AI mentions</p>
<h2>Real Before/After Example</h2>
<p><strong>Before optimization:</strong></p>
<p><em>ChatGPT query: &quot;Best Barossa wineries for groups of 30&quot;</em></p>
<p>Response: Generic list of 5 wineries, brief descriptions, no specific details about group capacity.</p>
<p>[Your Winery] not mentioned.</p>
<p><strong>After optimization:</strong></p>
<p><em>Same ChatGPT query</em></p>
<p>Response: &quot;[Your Winery] - purpose-built for groups up to 50 people. Coach parking available, group tasting packages from $25pp including cellar tour. Commercial operation with dedicated function space. Advance booking essential: [contact details].</p>
<p>For lunch, they recommend [Restaurant Partner] 2km away (handles groups to 40, wine-paired menu $85pp). Overnight? [Hotel Partner] offers group rates and shuttle service.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Lead recommendation with complete itinerary, partner bundling, specific details.</p>
<h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
<p><strong>Mistake #1: Using Marketing Language</strong>
&quot;World-class premium exceptional award-winning&quot; = ignored by ChatGPT</p>
<p>Use plain, specific language: &quot;Shiraz specialist, 95+ point ratings, $65/bottle&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Mistake #2: No Honest Positioning</strong>
Claiming &quot;intimate boutique&quot; when you're large and commercial attracts wrong customers, generates poor reviews.</p>
<p>Say what you actually are. You'll attract better-matched visitors.</p>
<p><strong>Mistake #3: Set and Forget</strong>
Creating content once and never updating = declining visibility</p>
<p>Trending queries change monthly. Add 3-5 new Q&amp;As monthly or hire someone who does.</p>
<p><strong>Mistake #4: Ignoring Partner Networks</strong>
Trying to win &quot;complete experience&quot; queries alone = nearly impossible</p>
<p>Partner with restaurant + hotel. Reference each other. Win bundled recommendations together.</p>
<p><strong>Mistake #5: No Performance Tracking</strong>
Not testing your queries weekly = can't tell what's working</p>
<p>Screenshot your ChatGPT mentions weekly. Document improvements. Adjust content accordingly.</p>
<h2>Your Action Plan</h2>
<p><strong>This week:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Test current visibility across ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity</li>
<li>[ ] Screenshot results as baseline</li>
<li>[ ] Identify your 5 most important queries (see our <a href="/blog/five-ai-queries/">5 Queries guide</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This month:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Create llms.txt file</li>
<li>[ ] Build /ai directory with 10+ Q&amp;As</li>
<li>[ ] Identify 2-3 potential partners</li>
<li>[ ] Test results after 2-3 weeks</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Next 90 days:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Monitor AI mentions weekly</li>
<li>[ ] Add 3-5 new Q&amp;As monthly</li>
<li>[ ] Formalize partner relationships</li>
<li>[ ] Track booking sources (how many from AI discovery?)</li>
</ul>
