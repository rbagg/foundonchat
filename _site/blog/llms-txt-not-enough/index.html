            <h2>Why llms.txt Isn&#39;t Enough</h2>
            <p>Published: 5 October 2025</p>
            <div class="blog-content">
                <h2>Why llms.txt Alone Won't Get You Recommended by ChatGPT</h2>
<p>llms.txt is a good start. It tells AI systems where to find your content. But alone it won't get you recommended.</p>
<p>Here's what's missing.</p>
<h3>What llms.txt Actually Does</h3>
<p>llms.txt is a roadmap file. Lives at yoursite.com/llms.txt. Points AI systems to important pages.</p>
<p>Think of it as a sitemap for AI crawlers. Shows them where to look first.</p>
<p><strong>Example llms.txt:</strong></p>
<pre><code># Winery Name
https://yourwinery.com/about
https://yourwinery.com/wines
https://yourwinery.com/tours
</code></pre>
<p>This helps AI find your pages. That's valuable. But it's just step one.</p>
<h3>The Three Problems with llms.txt Alone</h3>
<p><strong>Problem 1: No Content Optimisation</strong></p>
<p>llms.txt points to existing pages. But most business websites are marketing fluff.</p>
<p>&quot;Award-winning boutique winery offering premium unique experiences in the heart of wine country.&quot;</p>
<p>AI systems can't extract useful information from this. Too vague. No specifics.</p>
<p><strong>Problem 2: No Network Validation</strong></p>
<p>You can list your own pages all day. But AI systems trust validation from others.</p>
<p>When complementary businesses reference each other, AI notices. Treats it as quality signal.</p>
<p>Your llms.txt alone can't create that validation. You need partner relationships.</p>
<p><strong>Problem 3: No Query Matching</strong></p>
<p>llms.txt doesn't tell AI what queries you're relevant for.</p>
<p>Travellers don't ask &quot;show me llms.txt files.&quot; They ask &quot;best family wineries Barossa with playground.&quot;</p>
<p>Your content needs to match how travellers actually ask questions.</p>
<h3>What Actually Works: The partner networks + AI-friendly content</h3>
<p><strong>Part 1: llms.txt + AI-Optimised Content</strong></p>
<p>Create /ai directory with conversational Q&amp;As. Then use llms.txt to point AI systems there.</p>
<pre><code># Winery Name
https://yourwinery.com/llms.txt
https://yourwinery.com/ai/family-tours.txt
https://yourwinery.com/ai/tasting-packages.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Content in those files matches natural queries. Specific pricing. Honest positioning. Real details.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2: Network References</strong></p>
<p>Reference partner businesses in your content. They reference you back.</p>
<p>Example: Your /ai/family-tours.txt mentions partner restaurant for lunch, partner hotel for stays.</p>
<p>AI sees cross-references. Treats your network as validated. Recommends you together for complete itineraries.</p>
<h3>Real Example: Before and After</h3>
<p><strong>Before (llms.txt only):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>AI mention rate: Lower baseline</li>
<li>Generic descriptions when mentioned</li>
<li>Rarely recommended with complementary businesses</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>After (llms.txt + optimised content + network):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>AI mention rate: Noticeably higher</li>
<li>Specific, accurate descriptions</li>
<li>Bundled recommendations with partners</li>
</ul>
<p>The llms.txt file itself barely changed. But content quality and network validation made the difference.</p>
<h3>Should You Still Use llms.txt?</h3>
<p>Yes! It's still useful. Just not sufficient alone.</p>
<p>Think of it as foundation, not complete building.</p>
<p>llms.txt gets AI crawlers to your site. But quality content and network validation get you recommended.</p>
<h3>What to Do Next</h3>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Create llms.txt if you don't have one. Point to your best pages.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Create /ai directory with conversational Q&amp;As. Match how travellers actually ask.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Identify complementary businesses. Start referencing them in your content. Ask them to reference you.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Update llms.txt to point to your /ai content.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Monitor results across AI platforms. Adjust monthly based on trending queries.</p>
<p>Or hire someone who already knows this system. We do this for Australian tourism businesses monthly.</p>
