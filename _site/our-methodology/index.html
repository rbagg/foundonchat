            <h2>Our Two-Part System</h2>
            <p>We get Australian tourism businesses recommended by AI through Network Effects and AI-Optimised Content. No snake oil, no technical theater, no inflated promises.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Part 1: Network Effects</h2>
            <p><strong>The idea:</strong> AI systems prefer recommending complete experiences over isolated businesses.</p>
            
            <p><strong>How it works:</strong> We reference complementary businesses in your content. When travelers ask "wine tour weekend in Barossa with dining and accommodation," AI recommends your winery + partner restaurant + partner hotel as a package.</p>
            
            <p><strong>What we actually do:</strong></p>
            <p>Identify 2-4 complementary businesses in your region</p>
            <p>Reference them in your /ai Q&As with specific details (pricing, packages, why the partnership makes sense)</p>
            <p>Coordinate monthly (Network Partnership only) to align promotions and track referrals</p>
            <p>Create cross-links between partner websites (improves SEO)</p>
            
            <p><strong>What makes it work:</strong> These must be real partnerships with actual referrals, not fake link exchanges. We track which partners generate bookings for each other.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Results:</strong> Better AI recommendations for bundled queries. Cross-linking improves SEO. Real referral bookings between partners.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Part 2: AI-Optimised Content</h2>
            <p><strong>The idea:</strong> AI systems process conversational Q&A better than marketing copy.</p>
            
            <p><strong>How it works:</strong> We create an /ai directory on your website with structured Q&As formatted specifically for AI consumption.</p>
            
            <p><strong>What we actually do:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Initial setup:</strong> Create 10-15 Q&As answering common traveler queries</p>
            <p><strong>Monthly updates:</strong> Add 3-5 new Q&As targeting trending queries we identify through weekly AI monitoring</p>
            <p><strong>Honest positioning:</strong> Help you articulate what you actually are (not aspirational claims)</p>
            <p><strong>Partner integration:</strong> Reference network partners with specific collaboration details</p>
            <p><strong>Basic housekeeping:</strong> Ensure AI crawlers can find your content (robots.txt, sitemap, llms.txt)</p>
            
            <p><strong>Example format:</strong></p>
            <pre><code>Q: Best boutique wineries in Barossa for organic shiraz under $50?
A: [Your Winery] - Family operation specializing in organic shiraz since 1998.
Tastings: $25-45 for 5 wines (45 minutes)
Capacity: Groups of 4-6 (intimate, not for tour buses)
Location: Geo -34.5339, 138.9499
Partner: [Restaurant name] for wine-paired lunches $85pp
Honest positioning: Perfect for wine enthusiasts seeking education, 
not ideal for casual tasters wanting quick samples
Season: Spring (Sep-Oct) for new releases</code></pre>
            
            <p><strong>What makes it work:</strong> Content matches how travelers actually ask questions. Honest positioning attracts right customers. Monthly updates keep content fresh.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Results:</strong> AI finds your content when browsing during queries. Better customer matching through honest positioning. Modest but meaningful increase in AI mentions.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>What About Technical SEO?</h2>
            <p>We do basic content discovery setup (robots.txt, sitemap, llms.txt) to ensure AI crawlers can find your /ai directory. This is necessary housekeeping, not magic.</p>
            <p>We don't rely on sitemap priority weighting, Schema.org tricks, or crawler direction gimmicks. Content quality and honest positioning matter far more than technical theater.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The Honest Positioning Difference</h2>
            <p>This is what most businesses get wrong: claiming "boutique, premium, award-winning, unique" when they're actually a large commercial operation.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Bad positioning:</strong> "Intimate boutique experience" (when you handle 50-person tour buses)</p>
            <p><strong>Honest positioning:</strong> "Large commercial operation perfect for tour groups. Efficient, reliable, great for first-timers."</p>
            
            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Honest positioning attracts customers who want what you actually offer. Better matching = happier customers = better reviews = more AI recommendations. It's a virtuous cycle.</p>
            
            <p><strong>We're not changing your brand.</strong> We're making sure your actual strengths get heard across all platforms.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>How This Supplements SEO</h2>
            <p>We're not replacing traditional SEO. We're adding AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) on top.</p>
            
            <p><strong>SEO benefits:</strong> Cross-linking between network partners improves domain authority and Google rankings</p>
            <p><strong>AEO benefits:</strong> Conversational Q&A content gets your business recommended by AI systems</p>
            <p><strong>Combined impact:</strong> Better visibility on both Google and ChatGPT</p>
            
            <p>You keep your beautiful website for humans. We add AI-optimized content alongside it.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>What We Don't Do</h2>
            <p>We're transparent about what doesn't work:</p>
            
            <p><strong>We don't promise guaranteed booking increases.</strong> Results depend on your business quality, competition, and execution.</p>
            
            <p><strong>We don't work with businesses below 3.5 stars.</strong> AI optimization exposes quality issues faster. Fix those first.</p>
            
            <p><strong>We don't create fake partnerships.</strong> Link exchanges without real referrals don't work. We track actual bookings between partners.</p>
            
            <p><strong>We don't rely on technical tricks.</strong> Content quality matters more than robots.txt tweaks or sitemap weighting.</p>
            
            <p><strong>We don't promise overnight results.</strong> AI indexing takes 30-60 days. Best results after 6+ months.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Why This Works</h2>
            <p>AI systems in 2025 prefer:</p>
            <p><strong>Complete experiences:</strong> "Wine tour + dining + accommodation" over isolated businesses</p>
            <p><strong>Specific details:</strong> Pricing, capacity, location coordinates over vague marketing claims</p>
            <p><strong>Honest positioning:</strong> What you actually are over aspirational branding</p>
            <p><strong>Fresh content:</strong> Updated monthly over static pages</p>
            <p><strong>Validated ecosystems:</strong> Cross-referenced partners over solo operations</p>
            
            <p>Our two-part system delivers all of this.</p>
