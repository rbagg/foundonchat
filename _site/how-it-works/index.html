            <h2>How We Get You Recommended by AI</h2>
            <p>Setup takes 3-4 weeks. Results start appearing in 30-60 days (AI indexing takes time). Best results after 6+ months as network effects compound.</p>

            <h2>Step 1: Free 30-Minute Audit</h2>
            <p>See where you stand before committing.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Live AI testing:</strong> We test your business across ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Grok in real-time. You watch as we ask questions like "best wineries in Barossa Valley" and see if you appear.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Competitor analysis:</strong> Which businesses in your region are winning AI recommendations and why.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Network opportunity mapping:</strong> We identify 3-5 potential partner businesses perfect for referral relationships.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Honest positioning workshop preview:</strong> We help you articulate what you actually are (not aspirational). Example: "Large operation perfect for tour buses" vs claiming "intimate boutique."</p>
            
            <p><strong>Custom roadmap:</strong> Exactly how we'd implement both parts (Network Effects + AI-Optimised Content) for your business.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Realistic projection:</strong> Expected improvements based on similar businesses. We give ranges, not guarantees.</p>
            
            <p>No obligation. The audit alone gives you valuable insights.</p>
