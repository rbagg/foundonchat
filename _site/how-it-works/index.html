    <h2>How We Get You Recommended by AI</h2>
    <p>Setup takes 3-4 weeks. Results start in 30-60 days (AI indexing takes time). Best results after 6+ months as network effects compound.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Step 1: Free 30-Minute Audit</h2>
    <p>See where you stand before committing.</p>
    
    <h3>Live AI Testing</h3>
    <p>We test your business across ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Grok in real-time. You watch as we ask questions like "best wineries in Barossa Valley."</p>
    <p>See if you appear. How you're described. Where you rank vs competitors.</p>
    
    <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
    <p>Which businesses in your region win AI recommendations and why. What they're doing differently.</p>
    
    <h3>Network Opportunity Mapping</h3>
    <p>We identify 3-5 potential partner businesses perfect for referral relationships. Show you who to approach.</p>
    
    <h3>Honest Positioning Workshop Preview</h3>
    <p>We help articulate what you actually are (not aspirational). Example: "Large operation perfect for tour buses" vs claiming "intimate boutique."</p>
    
    <h3>Custom Roadmap</h3>
    <p>Exactly how we'd implement both parts (Network Effects + AI-Optimised Content) for your business.</p>
    
    <h3>Realistic Projection</h3>
    <p>Expected improvements based on similar businesses. We give ranges, not guarantees.</p>
    
    <p>No obligation. The audit alone gives valuable insights.</p>

    <h2>Step 2: Setup (Week 1-4)</h2>
    
    <h3>Week 1-2: Network Effects Setup</h3>
    <p><strong>Network Partnership clients:</strong> We contact chosen partners. Invite them to join. Coordinate kickoff meeting. Create partnership agreements. Set up referral tracking.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Individual clients:</strong> We identify ideal partners. Provide outreach templates. Show successful partnership examples.</p>
    
    <p><strong>All clients:</strong> We plan cross-linking strategy. Identify natural collaboration opportunities.</p>
    
    <h3>Week 2-3: AI-Optimised Content Creation</h3>
    <p><strong>Honest positioning workshop:</strong> 90-minute session to define what you actually are. Target audience clarity. Differentiation. Review analysis.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Create your /ai directory:</strong> 10-15 Q&As in conversational format matching how travelers ask questions.</p>
    <p>Example: "Q: Best large-group wineries Barossa with tour bus access? A: We're a commercial operation perfect for groups of 20-50..."</p>
    
    <p><strong>Build llms.txt:</strong> Roadmap file pointing AI systems to your /ai content. Lists network partners.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Basic content discovery:</strong> Configure robots.txt to allow AI crawlers. Update sitemap. Add internal links. Necessary housekeeping.</p>
    
    <h3>Week 3-4: Testing & Launch</h3>
    <p><strong>AI platform testing:</strong> Test across ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Grok with 10 query variations.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Crawler verification:</strong> Confirm AI crawlers access your llms.txt and /ai files.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Network testing:</strong> Verify partner cross-references are indexed.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Baseline metrics:</strong> Document starting point (mention frequency, recommendation quality, competitive position).</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Step 3: Ongoing Optimization (Monthly)</h2>
    
    <h3>Weekly AI Monitoring</h3>
    <p>We test your business across all AI platforms weekly. Track mention rates. Identify trending queries.</p>
    
    <h3>Monthly Content Updates</h3>
    <p><strong>Add 3-5 new Q&As</strong> targeting trending queries we identified.</p>
    <p><strong>Seasonal adjustments:</strong> Update for harvest seasons, holiday periods, weather changes.</p>
    <p><strong>New offerings:</strong> Add new tours, menu items, room types, experiences.</p>
    <p><strong>Pricing updates:</strong> Keep package prices current.</p>
    
    <h3>Network Coordination (Network Partnership Only)</h3>
    <p><strong>Monthly calls:</strong> 45-minute Zoom aligning promotions (e.g., "Barossa Wine + Dine Weekend").</p>
    <p><strong>Quarterly strategy sessions:</strong> Full network meeting to plan seasonal campaigns.</p>
    <p><strong>Referral tracking:</strong> Show each partner how many bookings came from network.</p>
    
    <h3>Monthly Performance Report</h3>
    <p>AI mention frequency (% of relevant queries)</p>
    <p>Platform breakdown (which AI systems mention you most)</p>
    <p>Trending queries (new question types triggering your business)</p>
    <p>Competitive position (your ranking vs top competitors)</p>
    <p>Content performance (which Q&As trigger most mentions)</p>
    <p>Network referrals (if applicable)</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Expected Timeline</h2>
    
    <h3>Week 1-4: Setup</h3>
    <p>Files deployed. Network partnerships established. AI hasn't indexed yet. Mention rate: 0-5% (baseline).</p>
    
    <h3>Week 5-8: Initial Indexing</h3>
    <p>Crawlers accessing your content. Not yet prioritized in recommendations. Mention rate: 5-15%.</p>
    
    <h3>Week 9-16: Acceleration</h3>
    <p>Consistent mentions increasing. Network validation occurring. Mention rate: 20-40%.</p>
    
    <h3>Week 17+: Sustained Performance</h3>
    <p>Stable mention rate. Top positioning in your category for right queries. Mention rate: 40-70% (varies by business and network participation).</p>
    
    <h3>Reality Check</h3>
    <p>Results depend on: Business quality (reviews matter). Regional competition. Honest positioning execution. Network participation. Seasonal factors.</p>
