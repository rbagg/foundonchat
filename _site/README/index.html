<p>FoundOnChat - Tourism AI Optimization
Welcome to FoundOnChat, Australiaâ€™s pioneering tourism AI optimization agency. This repository powers our website (yourusername.github.io/foundonchat), designed to help wineries, restaurants, accommodations, and tour operators across Australia get discovered by travelers using AI platforms like ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Grok. Launched in 2025, we optimize businesses for AI queries (e.g., &quot;best wineries Barossa Valley&quot;) with tools like llms.txt, custom content, and network partnerships.
