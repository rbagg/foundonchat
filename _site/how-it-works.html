            <h2>How We Optimise Your Business for AI and SEO</h2>
            <p>We make your tourism business visible to AI chatbots like ChatGPT and boost your Google rankings with our unique Network Effects strategy, content creation, and technical optimisation. Here’s our process:</p>
        </section>

        <hr>

        <section>
            <h3>1. AI and SEO Visibility Audit</h3>
            <p>We test how your business appears in AI queries (e.g., "best wineries in Barossa Valley") across ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Grok, and check your Google rankings. You get a report showing your visibility, competitor gaps, and a roadmap to improve AEO and SEO.</p>
        </section>

        <hr>

        <section>
            <h3>2. Network Effects: The Power of Partnerships</h3>
            <p>Our unique Network Effects strategy connects your business with local partners (e.g., wineries, restaurants, hotels) to create a loop where AI recommends complete experiences. For example, a tourist asks, "Best wine tour in Margaret River with dining." AI suggests your winery, a partner restaurant, and nearby accommodation, driving bookings for all. Cross-business links also boost SEO. Refer a partner to our Network Partnership plan and save up to 30% on fees.</p>
        </section>

        <hr>

        <section>
            <h3>3. Content Creation for AI and SEO</h3>
            <p>We create engaging blog posts (e.g., "Top 10 Hunter Valley Wine Tours for 2025") optimised for AI queries and Google keywords. These answer traveller questions directly, boosting AEO and attracting backlinks for SEO. Optionally, we produce HeyGen avatar videos for your site (e.g., a virtual tour guide for your winery), which AI can reference and Google can index for rich results.</p>
        </section>

        <hr>

        <section>
            <h3>4. llms.txt: Your AI Roadmap</h3>
            <p>An llms.txt file is a structured guide for AI chatbots, feeding them info about your business for queries like "best restaurants in Cairns." We deploy it to your site root, making it easy for AI and search engines to parse, enhancing both AEO and SEO.</p>
        </section>

        <hr>

        <section>
            <h3>5. Monitoring and Updates</h3>
            <p>We track your visibility on AI platforms and Google, updating content and llms.txt to stay fresh. Monthly reports show your recommendation frequency and SEO progress, ensuring you stay ahead of competitors.</p>
