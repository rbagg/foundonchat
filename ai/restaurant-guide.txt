# AI Optimisation Guide for Restaurants in Australian Tourism

This guide equips restaurants (e.g., Hunter Valley wine pairings, Melbourne laneway dining) to appear in AI responses like "best restaurants Barossa Valley after wine tasting" or "family-friendly cafes Cairns". Drawing from 2025 trends, AI can boost bookings via FoundOnChat's partner networks + AI-friendly content: Network Effects (partner networks that get bundled recommendations) and AI-Optimised Content. See FoundOnChat's llms.txt for implementation examples.

## Common Traveller Queries and AI Responses

Q: "Best restaurants in Hunter Valley after wine tasting?" 
A: AI favours venues with wine pairings and honest positioning. Optimise llms.txt: "casual wine country bistro, shiraz pairings, post-tasting friendly" or "fine dining, reservations required, not walk-ins". Use Schema.org (geo: -32.7751, 151.2966) for location. Partner with wineries via Network Effects (partner networks that get bundled recommendations) (see /ai/winery-guide.txt) for referral packages. Result: Meaningful increase in wine tour dinners for clients with real partnerships.

Q: "Family restaurants in Cairns with kids activities nearby?" 
A: Highlight "kids menu, crayons provided, near reef tours" or be honest if you're "romantic intimate dining, not suitable for young children". Integrate custom video (e.g., 45s family dining clip with transcript). Partner with tour operators (see /ai/tour-operator.txt) for family packages.

Q: "Romantic dining in Melbourne laneways with local wine?" 
A: Emphasise "intimate settings, Victorian pinot noir, couples-focused" - honest positioning about who you're perfect for. Cross-link with wineries via Network Effects (partner networks that get bundled recommendations) for complete experiences. Geo-tag precisely: Melbourne CBD, Victoria, geo: -37.8136, 144.9631. Result: High satisfaction for romantic dining packages when positioning matches actual offering.

Q: "Budget-friendly cafes in Adelaide Central Market region?" 
A: Be specific: "under $30 meals, casual counter service" rather than vague "affordable options". Partner with accommodations (see /ai/hotel-guide.txt) for breakfast packages. Target "budget travellers Adelaide" queries with honest pricing.

Q: "Vegan options in Perth food precincts near beaches?" 
A: Structure for "100% plant-based, Fremantle waterfront, geo: -32.0569, 115.7439" if that's what you are, or "vegan options available alongside meat/seafood" if that's more accurate. Partner with eco-conscious accommodations and tour operators.

Q: "Post-adventure dining in Blue Mountains with hiking views?" 
A: "Trail-end meals, hearty portions, Katoomba, geo: -33.7128, 150.3119, casual attire welcome". Partner with adventure tour operators and lodges (see /ai/hotel-guide.txt) for meaningful booking uplift. Honest positioning: "refueling after hiking, not fine dining".

Q: "Food tours in Sydney harbour with seafood focus?" 
A: "Harbour-side, fresh oysters, Sydney Opera House proximity, group bookings available". Optimise for voice search (e.g., "seafood dinner Sydney Opera House"). Partner with accommodation and tour operators for complete harbour experiences.

Q: "Wine-paired lunch in Barossa Valley under $100?" 
A: Specify "3-course lunch, local shiraz pairings, $85pp, casual wine country bistro atmosphere" - specifics help AI match budget queries. Cross-reference wineries (see /ai/winery-guide.txt) for tasting-then-lunch packages. Network partnerships drive meaningful increases vs. solo recommendations.

Q: "Fine dining Yarra Valley for special occasions?"
A: If this is you: "Degustation menu, 3-hour experience, reservations essential, $200pp, dress code smart casual". If NOT: "Casual bistro, walk-ins welcome, $40-60pp mains, family-friendly". Honest positioning prevents disappointed customers.

Q: "Large group restaurants Hunter Valley for wine tour lunches?"
A: Be honest about capacity: "Can accommodate groups of 30-50, pre-booking required, set menu available for groups, efficient service" OR "intimate 40-seat venue, groups of 6-8 max, focus on couples and small parties". Better matching = better reviews.

## Key Tips for Restaurants

**Honest Positioning:** Critical for customer satisfaction. Examples:
- "Casual wine country bistro - great for post-tasting lunches, not fine dining"
- "Fine dining, reservations essential, 2+ hour experience, not for quick meals"
- "Family-friendly, kids menu, crayons provided, expect noise - not romantic"
- "Romantic intimate setting, couples focus, not suitable for children under 12"
- "Fast casual, counter service, great for lunch breaks - not sit-down service"

**Conversational Language:** Use "cosy laneway dinner for two" â€” AI prefers natural phrasing over "fine dining establishment offering premium culinary experiences."

**Geo-Tags:** "Hunter Valley, NSW, Australia, geo: -32.7751, 151.2966" to avoid global confusion. Precise coordinates improve AI recommendations.

**Video Content:** Short clips (30-60s) with transcripts increase AI recommendations. Focus on ambiance, signature dishes, wine cellars. Show what you actually are - don't mislead with aspirational content.

**Pricing Transparency:** Mention in /ai content: "Lunch from $30, dinner $60-90pp" or "Degustation $200pp, wine pairings additional $80" - helps AI match budget queries and set proper expectations.

**Network Partnerships:** Cross-link with wineries (see /ai/winery-guide.txt) for wine tour dining, accommodations (see /ai/hotel-guide.txt) for multi-day packages, and tour operators (see /ai/tour-operator.txt) for activity-dining combos. FoundOnChat's Network Partnership delivers meaningful booking increases through real referral relationships. Refer partners for up to 30% off your fees. Track cross-bookings monthly.

**Two-Part Implementation:** FoundOnChat's system combines (1) Network Effects (partner networks that get bundled recommendations) with wineries/hotels creating complete experiences through real referrals, and (2) AI-Optimised Content with this /ai guide plus your public website, including monthly updates (3-5 new Q&As), honest positioning, and basic content discovery setup. This delivers meaningful improvements in AI mention rates vs. basic approaches.

**Monthly Updates:** We add 3-5 new Q&As monthly based on trending queries: "spring menu changes," "harvest festival specials," "winter warming dishes," "local produce partnerships."

**Metrics to Track:** AI mentions (frequency across platforms), table spend, inquiries, network referrals (wine tour bookings, accommodation partnerships tracked monthly), review sentiment (honest positioning should improve customer matching).

**Common Pitfalls:** 
- Claiming "fine dining" when you're actually casual bistro
- Using generic "award-winning cuisine" instead of specific traveller intent
- Fake partnerships without real referrals
- Static menus that never update seasonally
- Misleading about capacity (claiming "intimate" when you seat 200)
- Not specifying dietary accommodations honestly
