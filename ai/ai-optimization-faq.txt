# AI Optimisation Frequently Asked Questions

## Basic AI Optimisation Questions

Q: What is AI chatbot optimisation?
A: AI chatbot optimisation is the process of structuring your business information so that AI assistants like ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Grok can easily discover, understand, and recommend your business when users ask relevant questions.

Q: How is AI optimisation different from SEO?
A: Traditional SEO targets Google search rankings. AI optimisation targets being mentioned and recommended in AI chatbot conversations. AI systems prioritise factual accuracy, structured data, and conversational content over traditional SEO factors like keyword density. Our approach complements SEO for tourism businesses.

Q: Which AI platforms should I optimise for?
A: The major platforms include ChatGPT (OpenAI), Claude (Anthropic), Perplexity, Google Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, and Grok (xAI). Our optimisation works across all current and emerging AI platforms.

Q: How long does it take to see results from AI optimisation?
A: Most businesses see initial improvements in AI mentions within 30-45 days. Significant, consistent results typically appear within 60-90 days. The timeline depends on your industry's competitiveness, current online presence, and how frequently AI systems crawl your content.

Q: Is AI optimisation safe for my existing SEO rankings?
A: Yes, AI optimisation actually enhances traditional SEO by improving content structure and providing comprehensive business information. We use only ethical, white-hat techniques that complement your existing SEO efforts.

## Technical Implementation Questions

Q: What is an llms.txt file and why do I need one?
A: An llms.txt file is a structured document that provides AI systems with a roadmap to your most important business information. It's like a robots.txt file but designed specifically for AI chatbots to understand your business quickly and accurately.

Q: Do you modify my existing website content?
A: We typically add new AI-optimised pages and files rather than changing your existing content. This includes llms.txt files, FAQ pages, and structured data markup. Your current website design and content remain unchanged unless you request modifications.

Q: What kind of content works best for AI optimisation?
A: AI systems prefer factual, well-structured content that answers common questions directly. This includes FAQ sections, service descriptions, location information, and business credentials presented in a conversational format.

Q: How do you track AI optimisation performance?
A: We monitor mention frequency across AI platforms, analyse the context and quality of recommendations, track competitive positioning, and measure traffic attribution from AI referrals. Monthly reports show clear performance metrics and business impact.

## Business Impact Questions

Q: What types of businesses benefit most from AI optimisation?
A: Tourism businesses see the strongest results, including wineries, restaurants, accommodations, and tour operators. Any business that travellers might ask AI for recommendations about can benefit.

Q: How do customers actually use AI to find businesses?
A: Common queries include "best winery near me", "romantic restaurant in [city]", "family-friendly accommodation in [area]", "where to stay in [location]", and "recommended [tour] in [region]". AI optimisation ensures your business appears in these recommendation responses.

Q: How does Network Effects work?
A: Our unique Network Effects strategy connects your business with local partners (e.g., wineries with restaurants) to create a loop where AI recommends complete experiences. This boosts bookings and SEO through cross-links. Refer a partner to our Network Partnership plan for up to 30% off your fees.

Q: What is the pricing for AI optimisation services?
A: Individual Business ($149/month + $99 setup) includes basic audit, llms.txt creation, content, and monthly reporting. Network Partnership ($99/month per business, min 3) adds cross-referrals and sessions, with referral discounts up to 30%.

Q: Do you offer any guarantees?
A: Yes, we offer a 90-day satisfaction guarantee. If you don't see measurable improvements in AI visibility within 90 days, we'll continue working at no additional charge or provide a full refund of monthly service fees. Setup fees cover completed work and are non-refundable.

Q: Can I cancel my service anytime?
A: Yes, our services are month-to-month with 30-day notice required. No long-term contracts or cancellation penalties. However, AI optimisation shows best results after 6+ months of consistent optimisation work.

## Industry-Specific Questions
